They also kindly informed me that I’m an egomaniac who believes that I might be a chosen one. Unlike the first time, it was slightly better this time since it came from a Christian. Although, does that make it worse? I don’t know. I’m not sure I know how to spell good and evil anymore. Let me know if you know how to spell good and evil. Thanks.</p><p>Allegedly Christians like to ask the question what would Jesus do when facing ethical and moral choices, evidently it’s called discipleship otherwise known as following Jesus. I would like to reiterate my position once again and make another apology in advance for the language I’m about to use since I noticed that no mother fucker tries to learn what happened first before opening their mouths and informing me of their fucking opinions. I had zero mother fucking desire to be the fucking messiah and I still have zero mother fucking desire to be the messiah. I don’t know if I’m the fucking messiah, and you are more than fucking welcome to inform me about your fucking opinion after you learned what happened. I wrote them all down.</p><p>It’s been 157 days since I believed, and throughout this journey, I realised the m-word is a big no-no to mention to believers. And you would automatically receive the labels including but not limited to egomaniac, megalomaniac and narcissist. I couldn’t help but find it both ironic and sarcastic that Christians have been hoping for the second coming for over 2,000 years now and the immediate reaction they have when some random dude wants to show them evidence is to refer them to mental health services without bothering with glancing the evidence served up on a platter, despite the dude’s only wish is to find out why life became magic and why people lost reasoning capabilities overnight. Frankly, speaking from the perspective of a rampant homosexual who has more sexual partners in an hour every other day than the average heterosexual will have in their entire life, I kinda feel bad for Boss Man given the stigma and discrimination attached to His job title. He did have a pretty rough time and went on a sabbatical not long after a pretty bad workplace injury. I will check with Him next time we speak to see how’s that lawsuit preparation going and when He will be done with His career break. I’m pretty sure Dude’s a worse procrastinator than me.</p><p>I kinda asked Him for some stupid stuff when I first learned how to pray including but not limited to letting me suffer and save some random people including but not limited to rampant homosexuals. Whether or not He will allow me to, I don’t know. I trust Him and I did not trust myself even once in my entire life. He does tell me to stop working and go chill the fuck out somewhat regularly. The health insurance is pretty good with this Boss, and I heard a Colleague got injured three years into the job and Dude is still chilling on paid leave after 2,000 years. My former life ambition was to build an interesting tech startup and ideally work up to a net worth of 10-50 mil so that I could study and explore any extremely random interest that I somehow magically come up with every 3 to 6 months, and could still be in t-shirt and jeans without anyone bothering me. I was definitely on track with that with a mid-six-figure income at 27, then I tried to take my first holiday and you are reading about the ongoing nuclear fallout. I’m gonna work my ass off, both literally and figuratively, and see if I can also go on a sabbatical for something like forever and ever.</p><p>Feel free to get in touch after you find out about the m-word thing. To be honest, given how successfully we managed to fuck this up, I think the singular m-word might not be enough, and we might be able to unfuck this quicker if we start using the plural form. But it took decades for my community, some of whom are rampant homosexuals like me who enjoy getting fucked in the ass by talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt for 4hrs+ non-stop whilst listening to sick Berlin techno, to fight for our rights to be equal citizens of society, and we still face discrimination today. Statistically speaking, I think the m-word community will have a significantly harder time, but speaking from first-hand personal experience, statistics is a synonym for null in their dictionary. Big Man does not play dice with His creation.</p><hr /><h2 id="matthew-2422"><span class="me-2">Matthew 24:22</span><a href="#matthew-2422" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>[22] And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved.
