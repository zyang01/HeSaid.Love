[32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. (ESV)</p><p>As an overzealous servant with the new employment start date coinciding with my first romantic relationship, I felt kinda restless after spotting the potential connection between Matthew 10:34-36, the passages above, and my discoveries over the last 15 months. I bought the book Without Conscience by Dr. Robert D. Hare back in September after the Lord helped me realise the events I went through the year prior were essentially narcissistic abuse consecutively by multiple parties.</p><p>When I was at the campsite, I observed some fairly disturbing events, but I chose to believe in the goodness of my community since we are a marginalised group in society. I hid my sexuality growing up and didn’t experience the abuse towards people like me not that long ago. I get to comfortably enjoy being myself in a discreet manner largely due to the suffering people who went before me endured. They fought my fight before I was born and I am forever grateful to them for that.</p><p>If you read my posts, you might be surprised by the somewhat unconventional ways of living and experiencing the world. I realised I need to take a chill pill when it comes to my imagination as a servant. I was pretty crazy in the first 27 years of my life, and serving the King of Bosses kinda removed most if not all constraints that I once had. Boss Man was quite clearly about His sovereigty in Matthew 19:26. However, I do still need to be careful and diligent a mere mortal in service, and without His blessings I end up in existential dread again making six figures a year.</p><p>Regardless, I held my imagination back from the darkside when the following events occurred during those three months as the head of IT at Rosebay Naturist Camping, Peterborough.</p><ol><li><p>Multiple private conversations between fellow guests and I were shared with the campsite owner John without my consent or knowledge.</p><li><p>The campsite owner John complained several times to me that the majority of the things he heard about that weekend were about me setting up the WiFi.</p><li><p>In multiple occasions, he mentioned a recurring pattern of first timers making a heat of the moment decision to buy a caravan and moving in, but end up departing abruptly and never to be seen again, which evidently would cause inconvenience to management since he would have to take possession of the vehicle, and sell it when rent is overdue. There is an area around the back to store abandoned vehicle and I lent him a spanner when he extracted a gas bottle to aid a new guest.</p><li><p>There were non-stop hints and suggestions throughout the three month period that I would just whimsically disappear one day and not return again. I was rather troubled before going home for the first time in the first weekend of July, due to the continuous rain weeks prior, and the WiFi deployment was still a somewhat janky prototype. The spider and nature proof networking command centre with dedicated uninterruptable power supply that could provide 20hrs+ of emergency internet connection over Starlink was also delayed due to rain and the effort to maintain network uptime for guests. My neighbour’s partner quietly told me to call my neighbour should the worst was to happen after getting home.</p><li><p>I returned to the campsite 24hrs later and I could not comprehend the events that followed. There was a significant divergent between my understanding of the campsite and the reality that I was perceiving. Almost everyone turned their back on me overnight and guests I had only exchange greetings prior were accusing me of taking advantage of management to do whatever I desired. Their opinions were of such strength that they were not even willing to sit down and help me understand how I managed to turn the entire community on me. I asked and received go ahead for everything that I did at the campsite and tried to be mindful of guests to the best of my abilities.</p><li><p>The network I meticulously setup to maximise coverage over the course of three months satisfying every constraint the campsite boss layed out was ripped out overnight. They wiped the entire system and locked me out when I already prepared a one-click transfer and setup a WhatsApp group for a smooth transition.</p><li><p>I tried to have a conversation with the campsite boss to resolve whatever concerns he had on the second week of July. Over a four day period, I was shutdown mid sentence less than five minutes into the conversation and had my words twisted and stuffed back into my mouth forcefully. In my fourth and last attempt that week, I experienced what I later found out to be a depersonalisation episode when the campsite boss John picked up his phone and threaten to call help for me if I continued talking. I fell into a private home movie theatre watching myself in a conversation, exactly like the scene in the movie Get Out, but I didn’t know what “I” was talking about and the only thought I had was to get the fuck out ASAP. It was the first time in my life where words lost meaning and I felt an overwhelming threat to life if another word came out of my mouth. I had no memory of what I was trying to discuss with the campsite boss afterwards.</p></ol><p>I spent a lot of time learning about narcissistic personality disorder after getting kicked out. I nearly believed I was bipolar since I had very significant mood swings that I personally noticed, but was also blatantly announced in public by the campsite boss. I later realised I was being gaslit the entire time, my mood swings had a single common factor, and everyone’s opinion and attitude were firmly anchored on one unique influence.</p><p>None of the residents raised an eyebrow and evidently it was a regular iteration of build-up, put-down, and abandonment. My disturbed brain managed to produce some extremely dark and frightening theories. I later realised financial motives could not have been the main driver given the followers John has on OnlyFans and the online sales he boasted for the merch store. He also boasted about the amount he was spending on the facilities, which gave me the impression that he was building a hidden sanctuary for the community. The revenue he received was no where close to the amount he was spending due to the extremely low rent.</p><p>In hindsight, the main sport was manipulation. On busy weekends, over 200 visitors enter the gate. I sincerely hope my emotional intelligence belongs to the bottom percentile. The first two months at the campsite were the happiest two months I had despite the fact that I had a mental breakdown due to my overbearing mother. The campsite felt like a family where for the first time in a while I didn’t need to carry other people’s burden, it was the exact opposite where I was offered help even when I was not in need. I became a child again for two months and considered the campsite boss John a role model and father figure. The campsite boss informed me of certain rumours circulating around the campsite about a month into my residency. I was busy putting myself back together and running around to deploy an outdoor WiFi network whilst battling nature to experiment with off-grid living. I was never one to participate in small talks since I prefer to treat others how I would like to be treated. I was fine with people talking behind my backs as long as no harm was done, and I did not want to know who said what in order to not influence how I treat each person differently due to gossips that I could not reasonably verify.</p><p>I first learned of narcissistic personality disorder a month or two prior to my arrival at the campsite after identifying matching behavioural patterns on a former friend/business partner. For nearly six months prior, I was effectively tortured and harassed to produce detailed responses for a visa renewal application. I was having on average 5hrs of online work meetings daily, and would receive a barrage of phone calls and messages demanding an update on the visa application write-up if I failed to respond within the hour. Not treating their demand as top priority would attract scrutiny of my calendar, and explanations were required to justify my failure to recognise them as the center of the universe.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw me-1"></i> <a href="/tags/christbro/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >christbro</a> <a href="/tags/bible/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >bible</a> <a href="/tags/salvation/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >salvation</a> <a href="/tags/sheep/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >sheep</a> <a href="/tags/goats/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >goats</a></div><div class=" post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-5 pb-2 " ><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper d-flex align-items-center"> <span class="share-label text-muted">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=On%20Sheep%20and%20Goats%20-%20Aaron%20@%20He%20Said%20Love&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhesaid.love%2Fposts%2Fon-sheep-goats%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Twitter" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fa-brands fa-square-x-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=On%20Sheep%20and%20Goats%20-%20Aaron%20@%20He%20Said%20Love&u=https%3A%2F%2Fhesaid.love%2Fposts%2Fon-sheep-goats%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Facebook" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhesaid.love%2Fposts%2Fon-sheep-goats%2F&text=On%20Sheep%20and%20Goats%20-%20Aaron%20@%20He%20Said%20Love" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Telegram" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <button id="copy-link" aria-label="Copy link" class="btn small" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Copy link" data-title-succeed="Link copied successfully!" > <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link pe-none fs-6"></i> </button> </span></div></div></div></article></main><aside aria-label="Panel" id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 ps-2 text-muted"><div class="access"><section id="access-lastmod"><h2 class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</h2><ul class="content list-unstyled ps-0 pb-1 ms-1 mt-2"><li class="text-truncate lh-lg"> <a href="/posts/on-gethsemane/">On Gethsemane</a><li class="text-truncate lh-lg"> <a href="/posts/on-great-tribulation/">On Great Tribulation</a><li class="text-truncate lh-lg"> <a href="/posts/on-homosexuality/">On Homosexuality</a><li class="text-truncate lh-lg"> <a href="/posts/on-commandments-and-the-law/">On Commandments and the Law</a><li class="text-truncate lh-lg"> <a href="/posts/on-faith-precedes-reason/">On Faith Precedes Reason</a></ul></section><section><h2 class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</h2><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 me-3"> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/christbro/">christbro</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/salvation/">salvation</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/bible/">bible</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/love/">love</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/god/">god</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/faith/">faith</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/gospel/">gospel</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/secondcoming/">secondcoming</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/ai/">ai</a> <a class="post-tag btn btn-outline-primary" href="/tags/psychology/">psychology</a></div></section></div></aside></div><div class="row"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-9 px-md-4"><aside id="related-posts" aria-labelledby="related-label"><h3 class="mb-4" id="related-label">Further Reading</h3><nav class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-xl-3 g-4 mb-4"><article class="col"> <a href="/posts/on-faith-doubt/" class="post-preview card h-100"><div class="card-body"> <time data-ts="1732279300" data-df="ll" > Nov 22, 2024 </time><h4 class="pt-0 my-2">On Faith and Doubt</h4><div class="text-muted"><p>He practically removed doubts in my mind to a degree that I can either have faith or I can have doubt, but I can’t have both at the same time.
