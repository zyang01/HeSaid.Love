Even though English is my second language and I also speak Cantonese, Mandarin and a Chinese dialect as well as a tiny bit of German learned when I was partying in Berlin like there was no tomorrow, I stand by my choice of wording in expressing the accuracy of the sentiment and severity of the situation.</p><p>I consider the censorship of words for mere outward appearances as exemplified by esteemed hypocrites like politicians unnecessary and futile. All of humanity used to speak a single language before we thought too highly of ourselves and the Lord scattered us and confused our language. I double-checked with the Holy Spirit regarding the next statement. Every word in our language has its appropriate use case and there is no need to censor them if you intend to accurately convey meaning rather than to please esteemed hypocrites.</p><p>I would like to argue that if you have ever done that when going about the Lord’s business then you have already violated the commandment by false representation. I’m pretty sure that would be the case if you have ever told a member of my community that God hates homosexuals, or in fact, anyone that God hates them because of who they are or what they did. Please do not babble until you have figured out what you are talking about. If uncertain, double-check with the Holy Spirit or ask the Father for the Holy Spirit if you haven’t met Bro yet. Bro is a super cool Dude and I unfortunately have to question whether you truly believe if you haven’t met Bro.</p><p>I kinda know why He prepared my welcoming party to the United Kingdom 11 years ago before I even bought the plane ticket to London and why He told me to speak to my friend’s father the Christian missionary in mainland China when I had my first calling during COVID-19. If I walked into any church today and opened my mouth for five minutes, I would not be going back again as an implicit mutually beneficial agreement and understanding. I have been dancing around both of my guides and they don’t read my posts. I still haven’t told my guide in mainland China that I’m a rampant homosexual because his opinions on the issue are quite clear-cut on social media. I brought up the possibility that the sex I have might not involve lust at least on my part to my welcoming party yesterday at church and I repeatedly emphasised the fact that I use the password in 1 John 4:2 and he does not know about my sex life, but his stance on the issue did not allow me the sufficient opportunity to state my case and ask for guidance or directions for me to better understand and hopefully resolve the dilemma.</p><p>I came across the verses in Matthew 9:13 and 12:7 when looking into the references from Luke 11:13 below. I merely wanted to better understand God in my relationship with Him after He called me, but people’s minds are so rigid and blind-sighted by their view and interpretation of the world that we no longer even allow each other to finish our sentences anymore before shouting our own opinions. Few even do enough homework or due diligence to consider other possibilities for their arguments before opening their mouths. I rarely met anyone willing to admit their lack of understanding or knowledge on any subject. I think I can stop tiptoeing around people at church.</p><p>I will start saying what’s in my mind and my heart for the first time in my life after allowing everyone to finish their sentences and always consider views from their perspective first as much as I could reasonably achieve within the given context. I will speak with a clear conscience and Bro as my witness. For the first time in my life, I no longer need other people’s input as weights in my probabilistic model view of the world. I have THE source of truth with a binary HMI and response latency lower than ChatGPT and I’m switching to a free-will compatible deterministic model view of the world. I don’t know how it works as much as infinitely many other known and unknown mysteries of our universe. Feel free to submit your queries to Boss Man if you desperately want to know. I have got some house cleaning to do first.</p><p>I asked the Holy Spirit if I could call Him Bro. Dude’s cool with that.</p><hr /><p>Matthew 9:13</p><p>[13] Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” (ESV)</p><hr /><p>Matthew 12:7</p><p>[7] And if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. (ESV)</p><hr /><p>Luke 11:9–13</p><p>[9] And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. [10] For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. [11] What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; [12] or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? [13] If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (ESV)</p><hr /><p>Acts 2:37–40</p><p>[37] Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” [38] And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. [39] For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” [40] And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” (ESV)</p><hr /><p>Genesis 11:1–9</p><p>The Tower of Babel</p><p>[1] Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. [2] And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. [3] And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. [4] Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.” [5] And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. [6] And the LORD said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. [7] Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another’s speech.” [8] So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. [9] Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
