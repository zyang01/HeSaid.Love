Then, I had the epiphany that I already had the answer in the original post. We need to stop making <a href="../on-genesis-3-fall-man/" target="_blank">the mistake</a> we have been making since Genesis 3, the fall of man, and start putting God first rather than reason and end up with nothing but death. Seek Him first, and He will make our paths straight rather than lean on our insufficient understanding and go at it with our half-assed reasoning and comprehension.</p><hr /><h3 id="proverbs-318"><span class="me-2">Proverbs 3:1–8</span><a href="#proverbs-318" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart</p><p>[1] My son, do not forget my teaching,<br />     but let your heart keep my commandments,<br /> [2] for length of days and years of life<br />     and peace they will add to you.</p><p>[3] Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;<br />     bind them around your neck;<br />     write them on the tablet of your heart.<br /> [4] So you will find favor and good success<br />     in the sight of God and man.</p><p><strong>[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,</strong><br />     <strong>and do not lean on your own understanding.</strong><br /> <strong>[6] In all your ways acknowledge him,</strong><br />     <strong>and he will make straight your paths.</strong><br /> [7] Be not wise in your own eyes;<br />     fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.<br /> [8] It will be healing to your flesh<br />     and refreshment to your bones. (ESV)</p><hr /><p>I mentioned previously <a href="../on-holy-spirit-miracles/" target="_blank">the first call</a> we had after not speaking for 11 years with my welcoming party lasted 6.5 hours. We were arguing about semantic differences in the Bible. Boss Man told me to make the argument known to you in this post. I was 100% certain God exists, but only 95% about Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour in that call. My welcoming party was trying to bash me into confessing Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour. My issue with that? Tomato, tomahto. I could not comprehend the significance of the name Jesus since it’s written and pronounced differently in different languages. Why not stick with God when referring to God? Two days later, I read Romans 1-4 and felt the truth cutting through my bones into my soul. If you have never read Romans 1-4 before, Mr Noisy Gong kept talking about a Dude named Jesus Christ in it, which I later found out was a letter written to the Romans rather than a personal letter written to me by some dude named Roman. At that point, I was like “Okay, fine, all in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour.”</p><p>Now, if you subscribe to a religion, which I do not, or you have yet to encounter God personally, perhaps due to learning whatever through doctrine written by some historical figures whose names are not on the No. 1 bestseller of humanity, then I would advise you to ask God with your heart to show you who He is. <strong>We won’t get anywhere unless we fix the immediate problem of people thinking you are nuts the moment you bring up the three-letter word <em>God</em>.</strong> Our inability to let each other finish our sentences and instinctive rejection of God are getting ridiculous and out of control.</p><p>A new friend of mine mentioned the following highlighted verse from the Book of Joel yesterday.</p><hr /><h3 id="joel-22732"><span class="me-2">Joel 2:27–32</span><a href="#joel-22732" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>[27] You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,<br /> and that I am the LORD your God and there is none else.<br /> And my people shall never again be put to shame.</p><p>The LORD Will Pour Out His Spirit</p><p><strong>[28] “And it shall come to pass afterward,</strong><br />     <strong>that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;</strong><br /> <strong>your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</strong><br />     <strong>your old men shall dream dreams,</strong><br />     <strong>and your young men shall see visions.</strong><br /> [29] Even on the male and female servants<br />     in those days I will pour out my Spirit.</p><p>[30] “And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.

[14] Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it. [15] Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day. [16] Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.</strong> [17] For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. [18] He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. [19] Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. [20] You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear. [21] He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen. [22] Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.

[9] But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.</p><p><strong>[10] He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.</strong> [11] When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? [12] Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.</p><p>[13] There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, [14] and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. [15] As he came from his mother’s womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. [16] This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind? [17] Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.</p><p>[18] Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. [19] Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—this is the gift of God. [20] For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.

[8] But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. [9] But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. <strong>[10] For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.</strong> (ESV)</p><h2 id="luke-121315"><span class="me-2">Luke 12:13–15</span><a href="#luke-121315" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The Parable of the Rich Fool</p><p>[13] Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” [14] But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” <strong>[15] And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”</strong> (ESV)</p><h2 id="2-corinthians-969"><span class="me-2">2 Corinthians 9:6–9</span><a href="#2-corinthians-969" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The Cheerful Giver</p><p>[6] The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. [7] Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. <strong>[8] And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.</strong> [9] As it is written,</p><p>“He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;<br />     his righteousness endures forever.” (ESV)</p><h2 id="matthew-61924"><span class="me-2">Matthew 6:19–24</span><a href="#matthew-61924" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Lay Up Treasures in Heaven</p><p><strong>[19] “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, [20] but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.
