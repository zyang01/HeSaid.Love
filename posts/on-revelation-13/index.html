Some are more obscure, and unlikely, than others. Ezra 2:13 gives the number of descendants of Adonikam as 666. Because “Adonikam” means “the lord who rises up” or “lord of the enemy,” a few interpreters suggest the beast who rises from the earth will bear the name Adonikam. The mathematical value of 6x6x6 is 216, leading some to believe that this number, not “six hundred and sixty six” will be the “number of the name” of the beast.</p><p>In reality, no one knows exactly what 666 means. We can only draw on basic concepts to understand some of its implications. For example, 6 is one short of 7, which is the biblical number of perfection. The number 6 represents imperfection and is therefore man’s number. God is perfectly holy—thrice holy—as the seraphim of Isaiah’s vision proclaim. They called to one another, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts” (Isaiah 6:3). Repeating this three times emphasizes its absolute nature. By contrast, imperfect man is unholy, unholy, unholy: 6-6-6.</p><h2 id="ezra-213"><span class="me-2">Ezra 2:13</span><a href="#ezra-213" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>[13] The sons of Adonikam, 666.

In the Septuagint, depending on the manuscript and location, the name is given as Adon[e]ikam, Adonikan, Adeikam, Adenikam, Adaneikam or Adoniakaim.[57] In Nehemiah 7:18, his descendants were 667 instead of the previous number 666.[58]</p><embed src="https://dl.hesaid.love/Meaning_of_Onik_in_Adonikam.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" /><h2 id="1-corinthians-13813"><span class="me-2">1 Corinthians 13:8–13</span><a href="#1-corinthians-13813" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>[8] Love never ends.

A non-theistic humanist worldview asserts that religion is not a precondition of morality, and objects to excessive religious entanglement with education and the state.</p><p>Humanism - Wikipedia</p></blockquote><p>I discussed in <a href="../on-genesis-3-fall-man/" target="_blank">a previous post</a> something the crafty serpent gave the woman that she did not have before, which led to the fall of man in Genesis 3.

[3] One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast. [4] And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”</p><p>[5] And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. [6] It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. [7] Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them.

I was <a href="../on-going-home/" target="_blank">informed by an Israeli border officer last month</a> that the second beast performed great signs just the night before and made fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people. I was quite willing to walk into a special delivery from the second beast during my trip due to how faithful my “friends” had been.</p><p>I put down humanity/humanism/self and/or <a href="../on-drug-money-addiction/" target="_blank">drugs (money)</a> for the image of the beast. People kept telling me to think about myself first during my recent rollercoaster ride of six months, and less than a dozen people bought me coffee. It seems like most only think about me, myself and I all day and are extremely occupied with taking and posting selfies on Instagram or whatever trendy Web3 social media bullshit the crypto/tech bros are up to nowadays. I also learned that I’m one of those extremely rare idiots who do not worship themselves, consider themselves to be of the utmost importance in the head, nor consider themselves righteous all the time. No wonder I’m bankrupt and rent is 4.5 months overdue right now despite making mid-six-figures less than a year ago. I certainly cannot buy or sell right now. I have started my adult live-stream webcam career for a couple of weeks now. I’m still below the withdrawal minimum on Chaturbate and Stripchat due to my unwillingness to do private shows and my insistence on goodwill-only income, despite literally working my ass off and giving my best every single stream. It’s honestly extremely difficult to earn an honest living nowadays, probably not a path you want to go down if you consider yourself “wise”.</p><hr /><h2 id="2-timothy-319"><span class="me-2">2 Timothy 3:1–9</span><a href="#2-timothy-319" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Godlessness in the Last Days</p><p>[1] But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. [2] For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, [3] heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, [4] treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, [5] having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. [6] For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, [7] always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. [8] Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. [9] But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.

[3] Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, [4] who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. [5] Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? [6] And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. [7] For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. [8] And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. [9] The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, [10] and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. [11] Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, [12] in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
