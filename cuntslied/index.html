And the opening of the prison to those who are bound.</p><p>It is also a non-revocable open invitation with an expiry date of the end of time for anyone to slap me with humanity’s bestseller, metaphorically first and then literally only if successful metaphorically. The referee, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, will decide whether a metaphorical attempt is successful. If you have never held a humanity’s bestseller before, all you need to know is it will most certainly hurt.</p><p>Long story short, I believed for the 27 years of my previous life that if God existed, then He would hate a rampant homosexual like me based purely on religious stereotypes. My life hit rock bottom in 2024, and I almost threw myself off the fifth-floor balcony right in front of my younger sister before He came to save me. I bought a humanity’s bestseller a month prior, immediately after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite Rosebay in Peterborough, United Kingdom, for giving them free full-site Wi-Fi coverage because they were nice to me in the beginning and made me feel like an adopted son. During which my relationship with my biological family fell apart. I started reading the bestseller after a sequence of incomprehensible events. I documented the entire journey truthfully in my posts. I found out the straight cunts lied, and they most likely failed not only logical reasoning but also reading comprehension in school.</p><p>If any esteemed hypocrites tell you God hates you because of who you are or what you did, show them <a href="../posts/on-homosexuality/" target="_blank">this post on homosexuality</a>, <a href="../posts/on-blasphemy/" target="_blank">this post on blasphemy</a>, <a href="../posts/on-lust-and-guilt/" target="_blank">this post on lust and guilt</a>, and inform them politely that they took the Lord’s name in vain, and the Lord will not hold them guiltless. Know that you are loved. What the straight cunts do not know is some of us love getting poked in our buttholes, and some love poking buttholes, just as some hypocrites love hiking and some love travelling. We also spend significant effort in aftercare getting to know each other and exploring less abominable shared interests, including but not limited to philosophy and theology. Our love for each other could be out of <a href="../posts/on-sexual-theology/" target="_blank">genuine love and care rather than lust</a>. That said, there are also <a href="../posts/on-background-music/" target="_blank">lying cunts in our community</a>, as documented in my journey, and it is crucial to learn about discernment.</p><p>There are only two rules, and assuming you did not fail your logical reasoning and reading comprehension in school, you should be able to deduce the following. Don’t be <a href="../posts/on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt" target="_blank">a cunt</a>.</p><p>Whatever you do, do it with love, faith and hope. Love always comes first. We had to learn how to love by ourselves because some illogical and illiterate straight cunts lied. They built their houses on the sand, and we see the abomination of desolation that is <a href="../posts/on-faith-precedes-reason/" target="_blank">modern academia and higher education</a> today. Stupid cunts who could neither reason nor read are comparing theology with the study of unicorns and fairytales.</p><p>God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Most importantly, God is love. Love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.</p><hr /><h2 id="1-john-4712"><span class="me-2">1 John 4:7–12</span><a href="#1-john-4712" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>God Is Love</p><p>[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.

[9] For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [10] Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

[2] For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. [3] Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? [4] Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? [5] You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.

[38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (ESV)</p><hr /><h2 id="john-151217"><span class="me-2">John 15:12–17</span><a href="#john-151217" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. [13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another.

[2] And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. [3] If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</p><p>[4] Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant [5] or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; [6] it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. [7] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p><p>[8] Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. [11] When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. [12] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.</p><p>[13] So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
