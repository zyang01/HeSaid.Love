It was only fair because I missed several meetups by half an hour.</p>

<p>I was waiting outside London Bridge Station and had nothing to do. I started thinking about the Book of Jonah again. I want to call it my book, but that would be way too egotistical even for a delusional nutjob like me. I was thinking about Jonah’s prayer in chapter 2, specifically the last verse.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jonah-2">Jonah 2</h2>

<p>Jonah’s Prayer</p>

<p>[1] Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, [2] saying,</p>

<p>“I called out to the LORD, out of my distress,<br />
      and he answered me;<br />
 out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<br />
      and you heard my voice.<br />
 [3] For you cast me into the deep,<br />
      into the heart of the seas,<br />
      and the flood surrounded me;<br />
 all your breakers and your waves<br />
      passed over me.<br />
 [4] Then I said, ‘I am driven away<br />
      from your sight;<br />
 yet I shall again look<br />
      upon your holy temple.’<br />
 [5] The waters closed in over me to take my life;<br />
      the deep surrounded me;<br />
 weeds were wrapped about my head.<br />
 [6] To the roots of the mountains I went down,<br />
      to the land whose bars closed upon me forever.<br />
 Yet you brought up my life from the pit,<br />
      O LORD my God.<br />
 [7] When my life was fainting away,<br />
      I remembered the LORD,<br />
 and my prayer came to you,<br />
      into your holy temple.<br />
 [8] Those who pay regard to vain idols<br />
      forsake their hope of steadfast love.<br />
 <strong>[9] But I with the voice of thanksgiving</strong><br />
      <strong>will sacrifice to you;</strong><br />
 <strong>what I have vowed I will pay.</strong><br />
      <strong>Salvation belongs to the LORD!”</strong></p>

<p>[10] And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Annoyingly, I could not find the interpretation <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jonah/2/Jonah-2-9.html" target="_blank">on BibleRef</a>. So here is the interpretation <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-9.htm#:~:text=Book%C2%A0%E2%97%A6%C2%A0Chapter-,But%20I%2C%20with%20the%20voice%20of%20thanksgiving%2C,-Jonah%27s%20prayer%20from" target="_blank">from Bible Hub</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jonah-29---bible-hub">Jonah 2:9 - Bible Hub</h2>

<p><strong>But I, with the voice of thanksgiving,</strong><br />
Jonah’s prayer from the belly of the fish marks a turning point in his spiritual journey. The “voice of thanksgiving” signifies a heart of gratitude despite dire circumstances. This reflects a common biblical theme where thanksgiving is offered in faith, even before deliverance is realized (Philippians 4:6). Jonah’s gratitude foreshadows the New Testament teaching of giving thanks in all circumstances (1 Thessalonians 5:18).</p>

<p><strong>will sacrifice to You.</strong><br />
Sacrifice in the Old Testament often involved offerings at the temple, but here, Jonah speaks of a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving (Hebrews 13:15). This indicates a shift from ritualistic practices to a more personal and heartfelt devotion. Jonah’s commitment to sacrifice, even from within the fish, highlights the importance of internal worship over external rituals (Psalm 51:17).</p>

<p><strong>I will fulfill what I have vowed.</strong><br />
Vows in the ancient Near Eastern context were solemn promises made to God, often in times of distress, with the expectation of fulfillment upon deliverance (Ecclesiastes 5:4-5). Jonah’s vow likely pertains to his prophetic mission to Nineveh, which he initially fled. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of faithfulness to one’s promises to God (Numbers 30:2).</p>

<p><strong>Salvation is from the LORD!”</strong><br />
This declaration encapsulates the central theme of the Book of Jonah: God’s sovereignty and mercy in salvation. It echoes the broader biblical narrative that salvation is not earned by human effort but is a divine gift (Ephesians 2:8-9). Jonah’s acknowledgment prefigures the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan (Acts 4:12). This phrase also connects to the Psalms, where similar declarations of God’s deliverance are made (Psalm 3:8).</p>

<hr />

<p>I thought about my dire circumstances and hope for the Lord’s deliverance. I realised my hypocrisy again. I did not sign up to be a believer expecting any good stuff, and He did not tell me there was any. I thought faith was my only reward, and I only learned about blessings through scripture and Pastor Eric’s odd smile at the China Congregational Church in Hong Kong. Technically, the Lord delivered me already by saving my life last August. What more do I want than that?</p>

<p>Do I trust the Lord even before deliverance? Freaking yes. And absolutely. Do you?</p>

<p>I am extraordinarily annoyed at myself.</p>

<p>A faithful theologian friend suggested yesterday that I could join one of the 300+ political parties in the United Kingdom. I could get some experience in politics and learn the ropes that way.</p>

<p>I did another cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p>If I fail, I’m not doing His will. I lose the £150 non-refundable registration fee plus some change. I become a laughing stock if I’m not one already, and Boss Man takes up residence in a handful of minds for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>If I succeed in walking into British politics completely blind, leaning not on my own understanding, and trusting Him to guide me completely, I cannot think of a better way to demonstrate the power of God than that.</p>

<p>It sounds like a good deal to me. 🤔</p>

<p>Let’s turn up the love.</p>

For when I am weak, then I am strong. (ESV)</p>

<p>Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake</p>

<p>[8] Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. [9] Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. [10] For</p>

<p>“Whoever desires to love life<br />
      and see good days,<br />
 let him keep his tongue from evil<br />
      and his lips from speaking deceit;<br />
 [11] let him turn away from evil and do good;<br />
      let him seek peace and pursue it.<br />
 [12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,<br />
      and his ears are open to their prayer.<br />
 But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</p>

<p><strong>[13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. [17] For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.</strong></p>

<p>[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, [19] in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, [20] because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. [21] Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, [22] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

<p>Last October, I pulled a Jonah-style stunt in mainland China to stop the Book of Revelation. Before my flight to Hong Kong, I had the longest night in the first 27 years of my life. I submitted my application to naturalise as a British citizen the month prior. I was waiting for a decision from the Home Office. It was supposed to be the fruit of 11 years of work since I arrived in the United Kingdom at age 16. I fought my entire world, including my parents, to get to where I was. I had studied for four undergraduate degrees in the last decade, had a computer science degree from the University of Oxford, cared for my two younger siblings by providing financial support to their studies in London, and worked 3 to 4 full-time remote software engineering jobs simultaneously with a mid-six figure pretax income. I walked away from over a decade’s effort by boarding that flight back to Hong Kong. I essentially walked away from my entire life. I did that for a simple reason—unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy was inevitable due to my former business partner’s unfaithfulness. I tried every single friend I had. None came except Him. Bankruptcy would have a significant impact on my citizenship application. My former business partner and friends were effectively burning down my life’s work by refusing to help, even though I had served them faithfully for years in our relationships. I did not look back even once when I boarded that flight.</p>

<p>A faithful witness was the main sponsor of my global tour. She has been there since day 1 of this faith journey. We went to Chinese primary school and junior high school together. We had known each other for nearly two decades. And we exchanged messages once or twice a year before this journey. I considered her an acquaintance rather than a friend. She made a five-figure transfer the moment I asked for her help. She said she had always known she would help me with something someday. She is also the friend who dreamed about me in a war that matched details in the Book of Revelation. I had to Bible bash her into getting her first Bible.</p>

<p>You might not believe it, but I was not into playing with fire, poking the bear, walking on thin ice, or pulling the tiger’s tail. I had a lot of weird and eccentric adventures, but I was also a stickler for health and safety. I am the kind of guy who has half a dozen backup plans and can come up with a dozen more on the spot.</p>

<p>I went to the Hong Kong Baptist Church before crossing the border into mainland China. He locked me out of my hotel room with my first KJV Bible, my Caribbean passport with visa-free access to mainland China, the OpSec phone, and just enough cash to cross the border when I went to the Hong Kong Baptist Church. I cried halfway through Pastor Xander’s prayer. I felt nothing but peace and resolve after the prayer. The hotel staff had to break into my hotel room twice to help me get back in. I took a nap before getting on my way.</p>

<p>My faithful witness met me at the border. She tried to talk me out of my mission, but I made my decision. I opened my first Bible, read the Book of Jonah word by word, and prayed outside the police station in Shenzhen before turning myself in. An hour later, I stood outside the police station feeling utterly confused. I did not have a backup plan for that. The Book of Jonah also said it was supposed to be a three-day journey. The slacking would be way too obvious. One of the three things He promised was to take me where I wanted to go. I had always wanted to visit Shanghai and Beijing. It happened to be the week of celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Beijing was the lions’ den and in extra lockdown. Shanghai next?</p>

<p>I checked into the Shangri-La Hotel in Pudong, Shanghai, took a nap, had dinner and walked to the nearest police station. The police chief was fuming to be woken up and called in at 4 AM. He offered to buy me breakfast three hours later and asked me to wait patiently a little bit longer for his colleagues at the religious management bureau to start work. I signed and fingerprinted police statements after discussing epistemology and arguing over the wording to accurately reflect my intentions and the message I brought them. I was offered a ride back to the hotel and advised to enjoy my holiday and head home. I hoped to take the train from the Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station to Shenzhen. I could not get a train ticket as the week-long national holiday was about to end. The Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport was next door. Go big or go home. Beijing next.</p>

<p>I checked into the Four Seasons Hotel in Chaoyang District, Beijing and repeated the same routine. I met the friendliest police officer ever. I was in and out of the police station in Beijing within 10 minutes. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Say what you will about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They brought over a billion people out of poverty. I did not need to watch my back when wandering the city streets at 3 AM. Chinese constitution had an interesting amendment in 2018. The CCP has an interesting political motto—<strong>when people have faith, the nation has strength, and the country has a future</strong>.</p>

<p>Maybe we can learn a thing or two from China.</p>

<h2 id="matthew-13117">Matthew 13:1–17</h2>

<p>The Parable of the Sower</p>

<p>[1] That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. [2] And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. [3] And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. [4] And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. [5] Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, [6] but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. [7] Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. [8] Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. [9] He who has ears, let him hear.”</p>

<p>The Purpose of the Parables</p>

<p>[10] Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” [11] And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. [12] For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [13] This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. [14] Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:</p>

<p>“‘“You will indeed hear but never understand,<br />
      and you will indeed see but never perceive.”<br />
 [15] For this people’s heart has grown dull,<br />
      and with their ears they can barely hear,<br />
      and their eyes they have closed,<br />
 lest they should see with their eyes<br />
      and hear with their ears<br />
 and understand with their heart<br />
      and turn, and I would heal them.’</p>

<p>[16] But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. [17] For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. (ESV)</p>

<p>If I’m worried, concerned or scared, I’m not trusting Him. I can solve all of my problems by trusting Him. I cannot logically explain that to you. It is simply something that I believe and know without a single doubt in my mind. That does not mean I can sit around and chill. I still need to do my part to the best of my abilities. And God knows I freaking love to try a ton of whacky ideas. Dude needs to pull me back most of the time and tell me to chill. But otherwise, what is the point of existing if I do nothing at all?</p>

<p>I can trust Him and endure all things, including death and the world turning on me because I know He knows better than me.</p>

<p>He is <em><strong>God</strong></em>. What do I have to worry about?</p>

<p>It feels freaking weird, but I have to admit I’m loving it, reluctantly.</p>

<p>Proverbs 3:1–12</p>

<p>Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart</p>

<p>[1] My son, do not forget my teaching,<br />
      but let your heart keep my commandments,<br />
 [2] for length of days and years of life<br />
      and peace they will add to you.</p>

<p>[3] Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;<br />
      bind them around your neck;<br />
      write them on the tablet of your heart.<br />
 [4] So you will find favor and good success<br />
      in the sight of God and man.</p>

<p>[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,<br />
      and do not lean on your own understanding.<br />
 [6] In all your ways acknowledge him,<br />
      and he will make straight your paths.<br />
 [7] Be not wise in your own eyes;<br />
      fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.<br />
 [8] It will be healing to your flesh<br />
      and refreshment to your bones.</p>

<p>[9] Honor the LORD with your wealth<br />
      and with the firstfruits of all your produce;<br />
 [10] then your barns will be filled with plenty,<br />
      and your vats will be bursting with wine.</p>

<p>[11] My son, do not despise the LORD’s discipline<br />
      or be weary of his reproof,<br />
 [12] for the LORD reproves him whom he loves,<br />
      as a father the son in whom he delights. (ESV)</p>

<p>Teach me to have faith strong enough to walk on water. It sounds super fun. Jesus and Peter did it.</p>

<p>Give me strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. I needed that due to what happened.</p>

<p>Guide the people I know or meet back to Him, show them His light, and give them strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. It’s a good thing, and why not?</p>

<p>Give people I know or meet the Holy Spirit. It gets annoying when people think you are insane.</p>

<p>Let me die. Asked for that a bunch of times because people in my life have been really faithful.</p>

<p>Help me forgive because I really could not.</p>

<p>Thank Him because He was good to me in the first 27 years of my life even when I did not know Him. Not to mention He literally saved my life last year.</p>

<p>Let me rest because I have been working my ass off, and some people blew my first proper holiday.</p>

By the grace of God, I managed to secure the domain name <a href="https://www.faithparty.org/" target="_blank">FaithParty.org</a> earlier this morning for $7.66 (£5.91), the price of a cup of vanilla latte with coconut milk at London RPI with spare change. As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Rust</a> developer, I’m also a gigantic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" target="_blank">functional programming</a> (FP) fanboy.</p>

<p>I am working on the <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-06/RP1%20GB%20updated%20May%202023.pdf" target="_blank">RP1 GB form</a> (Application to register a political party in Great Britain). Due to my poor history of managing personal finance, I would raise more than a few eyebrows if I signed up to be the treasurer. I asked a faithful new friend if he would like the honour. I want the Lord to be the party leader, but I do not have the postcode for His current address. I am also reluctant to ask for His telephone number and email address. Therefore, I disgracefully nominated myself for the interim position. Hopefully, this will be the last time I try over-employment. I almost threw myself off the balcony when I did that last time.</p>

<h2 id="draft-launch-manifesto">Draft Launch Manifesto</h2>

<p>We make zero effort to pretend we have the answers and solutions to all our problems. No single human being in our party makes any final decisions. Only God has the final say. We reason within the boundaries and understanding He gives us. We will make mistakes. We are all flawed and imperfect, like the first man who sinned against God. We operate on one and only one law - love.</p>

<p>The definition of love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="romans-13814">Romans 13:8–14</h3>

<p>Fulfilling the Law Through Love</p>

<p><strong>[8] Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. [9] For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [10] Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</strong></p>

<p>[11] Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. [12] The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. [13] Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. [14] But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Our long-term goal is to restore faith in everyone’s heart so that we don’t, by default, assume the worst of each other. We want to build a society where we, by default, presume the best of each other. We don’t know how to achieve that (yet), but we can start with a tiny step at a time.</p>

<p>The three not-so-tiny steps we currently have on <a href="../on-money-and-fiscal-policy/" target="_blank">the agenda</a> are the following.</p>

<p>Shelter God’s children by taking them off the streets, feeding and putting a roof over them.</p>

<p>Reunite communities, including but not limited to LGBTQIA+, with God and let them know they are loved too.</p>

<p>Prepare humanity to defend against <a href="https://letter.hesaid.love/" target="_blank">the socioeconomic tsunami</a> brought about by Artificial Intelligence we have never seen before. We sincerely hope we are wrong, but we face significant unemployment rates and suffering globally for the bottom 90%.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="matthew-62534">Matthew 6:25–34</h3>

<p>Do Not Be Anxious</p>

<p>[25] “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. <strong>[33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</strong></p>

<p>[34] “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (ESV)</p>

<h3 id="isaiah-58">Isaiah 58</h3>

<p>True and False Fasting</p>

<p>[1] “Cry aloud; do not hold back;<br />
      lift up your voice like a trumpet;<br />
 declare to my people their transgression,<br />
      to the house of Jacob their sins.<br />
 [2] Yet they seek me daily<br />
      and delight to know my ways,<br />
 as if they were a nation that did righteousness<br />
      and did not forsake the judgment of their God;<br />
 they ask of me righteous judgments;<br />
      they delight to draw near to God.<br />
 [3] ‘Why have we fasted, and you see it not?<br />
      Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?’<br />
 Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure,<br />
      and oppress all your workers.<br />
 [4] Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight<br />
      and to hit with a wicked fist.<br />
 Fasting like yours this day<br />
      will not make your voice to be heard on high.<br />
 [5] Is such the fast that I choose,<br />
      a day for a person to humble himself?<br />
 Is it to bow down his head like a reed,<br />
      and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?<br />
 Will you call this a fast,<br />
      and a day acceptable to the LORD?</p>

<p><strong>[6] “Is not this the fast that I choose:</strong><br />
      <strong>to loose the bonds of wickedness,</strong><br />
      <strong>to undo the straps of the yoke,</strong><br />
 <strong>to let the oppressed go free,</strong><br />
      <strong>and to break every yoke?</strong><br />
 <strong>[7] Is it not to share your bread with the hungry</strong><br />
      <strong>and bring the homeless poor into your house;</strong><br />
 <strong>when you see the naked, to cover him,</strong><br />
      <strong>and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?</strong><br />
 <strong>[8] Then shall your light break forth like the dawn,</strong><br />
      <strong>and your healing shall spring up speedily;</strong><br />
 <strong>your righteousness shall go before you;</strong><br />
      <strong>the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.</strong><br />
 <strong>[9] Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;</strong><br />
      <strong>you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’</strong><br />
 <strong>If you take away the yoke from your midst,</strong><br />
      <strong>the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,</strong><br />
 <strong>[10] if you pour yourself out for the hungry</strong><br />
      <strong>and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,</strong><br />
 <strong>then shall your light rise in the darkness</strong><br />
      <strong>and your gloom be as the noonday.</strong><br />
 <strong>[11] And the LORD will guide you continually</strong><br />
      <strong>and satisfy your desire in scorched places</strong><br />
      <strong>and make your bones strong;</strong><br />
 <strong>and you shall be like a watered garden,</strong><br />
      <strong>like a spring of water,</strong><br />
      <strong>whose waters do not fail.</strong><br />
 <strong>[12] And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;</strong><br />
      <strong>you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;</strong><br />
 <strong>you shall be called the repairer of the breach,</strong><br />
      <strong>the restorer of streets to dwell in.</strong></p>

<p>[13] “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath,<br />
      from doing your pleasure on my holy day,<br />
 and call the Sabbath a delight<br />
      and the holy day of the LORD honorable;<br />
 if you honor it, not going your own ways,<br />
      or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly;<br />
 [14] then you shall take delight in the LORD,<br />
      and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth;<br />
 I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father,<br />
      for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.” (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="draft-party-emblem">Draft Party Emblem</h2>

<p>I have been working on the party emblem and have three draft designs. ChatGPT kept rebelling against my instruction to reflect the full party slogan—”Love in Action. Faith in People. Hope for the Future.”—in the design. I resorted to asking my faithful new friend again if he had any faithful artist friends who might be interested. The gig would be fully credited. The down payment is in the form of a bestseller with a full invoice paid on an unknown future date if they charge above-market premium rates.</p>

<h3 id="edit">Edit</h3>

<p>After checking out the emblems of <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/political-registration-and-regulation/political-party-registration" target="_blank">existing political parties</a> and double-checking with ChatGPT, I learned that party emblems submitted to the Electoral Commission for use on ballot papers must be in black and white. So here is the fourth draft. ChatGPT was reluctant to clean up the image for me again. It’s seriously starting to annoy the heck out of me. 🙄</p>

<h3 id="edit-again">Edit Again</h3>

<p>I took a nap and just woke up feeling annoyed again at ChatGPT. It kept refusing to clean up the 2020s on both sides of the emblem and arrange the slogan as I instructed. As I was lying in bed listening to Ed Sheeran’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34gCuhDGsG4bRPIf9bb02f?si=9f2626232c204b37" target="_blank"><em>Thinking out Loud</em></a>, I remembered the year 2020 was when I had my first calling. It was the first and only time I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA" target="_blank">MDMA</a> in my life, and I messaged my friend. We <a href="../on-confirmation/" target="_blank">matriculated</a> at <a href="../on-more-interesting-coincidences/" target="_blank">Keble College, Oxford</a> together. Her father is a Christian missionary in mainland China, who He told me to talk to, and He said the answers are there. As someone with a pretty severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder" target="_blank">OCD</a>, I like keeping records, and I found the messages I sent five years ago on WeChat. I had not even touched a humanity’s bestseller before then, let alone reading it. If you don’t read simplified Chinese, I used the pronoun ‘It’ rather than ‘He’. The mobile app version of Google Translate has a camera function that you can use. You tell me if He exists.</p>

<p>I had to do a reality check every morning, even in January this year. I would contemplate whether the last several months did happen, whether I had gone batshit crazy and if I should check into a mental hospital. Dude unscrewed and removed the door for me at this point. I cannot shut the door even if I want to. There is no going back. You cannot run away from God.</p>

<p>Now you know why <a href="../on-drugs/" target="_blank">I don’t do MDMA</a>.</p>

<p>And yes, I am fully aware of the implications of what I just publically admitted to. What did I say about telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and getting fucked in the ass by talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt for 4hrs+ non-stop whilst listening to sick Berlin techno?</p>

<h2 id="draft-party-constitution">Draft Party Constitution</h2>

<p>I cheated again by asking ChatGPT to write the draft party constitution. Frankly, I could not have done it better myself. It’s slightly longer than one page, but considering the legal and formal language involved, it’s still better than <a href="https://public.conservatives.com/organisation-department/202101/Conservative%20Party%20Constitution%20%20as%20amended%20January%202021.pdf" target="_blank">Conservative’s 58</a> and <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Rule-Book-2024.pdf" target="_blank">Labour’s 146</a>. You have to give credit where credit is due. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" target="_blank">full version</a> and more details can be found on humanity’s bestseller.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="luke-112932">Luke 11:29–32</h2>

<p>The Sign of Jonah</p>

<p>[29] When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. [30] For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. [31] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. [32] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. (ESV)</p>

<p>Unless there has been a major breakthrough in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing" target="_blank">CRISPR-Cas9</a>-related technologies that I am unaware of, I believe everyone is a son or daughter of a man.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this journey, I wondered whether the Son of Man wanted to finish reading the bestseller because it gets scary when things get too magical. The bestseller is also long-ass. Could that be why no one knows that day or hour? The Son of Man is human. And it would be an understandable sentiment for a fellow human being. That could be the case if the Son of Man is amongst us without knowing he is the Son of Man.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="matthew-243639">Matthew 24:36–39</h2>

<p>No One Knows That Day and Hour</p>

<p>[36] “But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. [37] For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [38] For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, [39] and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>For some weird reason, the following verse keeps calling and motivating me, unlike <a href="../on-revelation-13/#antichrist-not-christian" target="_blank">the antichrists</a> pretending to be Christians who informed me the desire to save people is a sign of pride.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="matthew-2422">Matthew 24:22</h2>

<p>[22] And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>I don’t know about the Son of Man. But I intend to finish reading the bestseller, start a political party in the United Kingdom, and save some rampant homosexuals this year. Totally unrelated to the following verse, I also found <a href="../on-condemnation/" target="_blank">little faith</a> and caught a bunch of <a href="../on-revelation-13/" target="_blank">false teachers and antichrists</a>. I wonder what kind of shitshow the Son of Man will find. That day will be fun for sure.</p>

<h2 id="luke-188">Luke 18:8</h2>

<p>[8] I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?” (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Also, are you fucking telling me no one has walked in His statues in the last 2,000 fucking years?</p>

<p>If you are <a href="../on-revelation-13/#antichrist-not-christian" target="_blank">an antichrist</a> pretending to be a Christian, feel free to let me know whether I accidentally climbed the Hall of Faith on my second week as a believer.

I intend to apply the principles in my personal life where applicable. Someone has got to start walking in His statutes, observing His commandments, and doing them.</p>

<p>If you like to doubt, which is understandable given that we are all human and imperfect, I would like to paraphrase Boss Man by saying, “Go and learn what this means: ‘He is the Lord our <strong><em>God</em></strong>.’”</p>

<p>If you are a “believer” who “thinks” I have gone batshit crazy, then please consider whether trust and belief are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation" target="_blank">transitive</a> and whether you truly believe if you consider me nuts. I would also strongly encourage you to take a revision course on the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Hebrews%2011%3A1" target="_blank">definition of faith</a> outlined in Hebrews 11. We should stop this wishy-washy nonsense, and you are either in or you are out. No more foot in both camps bullshit.</p>

<h2 id="edit">Edit</h2>

<p>After publishing the original post, I was thinking about the next major policy item - education, which would be an exceptionally tricky area for obvious reasons. Then, I had the epiphany that I already had the answer in the original post. We need to stop making <a href="../on-genesis-3-fall-man/" target="_blank">the mistake</a> we have been making since Genesis 3, the fall of man, and start putting God first rather than reason and end up with nothing but death. Seek Him first, and He will make our paths straight rather than lean on our insufficient understanding and go at it with our half-assed reasoning and comprehension.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="proverbs-318">Proverbs 3:1–8</h3>

<p>Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart</p>

<p>[1] My son, do not forget my teaching,<br />
      but let your heart keep my commandments,<br />
 [2] for length of days and years of life<br />
      and peace they will add to you.</p>

<p>[3] Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;<br />
      bind them around your neck;<br />
      write them on the tablet of your heart.<br />
 [4] So you will find favor and good success<br />
      in the sight of God and man.</p>

<p><strong>[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,</strong><br />
      <strong>and do not lean on your own understanding.</strong><br />
 <strong>[6] In all your ways acknowledge him,</strong><br />
      <strong>and he will make straight your paths.</strong><br />
 [7] Be not wise in your own eyes;<br />
      fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.<br />
 [8] It will be healing to your flesh<br />
      and refreshment to your bones. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>I mentioned previously <a href="../on-holy-spirit-miracles/" target="_blank">the first call</a> we had after not speaking for 11 years with my welcoming party lasted 6.5 hours. We were arguing about semantic differences in the Bible. Boss Man told me to make the argument known to you in this post. I was 100% certain God exists, but only 95% about Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour in that call. My welcoming party was trying to bash me into confessing Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour. My issue with that? Tomato, tomahto. I could not comprehend the significance of the name Jesus since it’s written and pronounced differently in different languages. Why not stick with God when referring to God? Two days later, I read Romans 1-4 and felt the truth cutting through my bones into my soul. If you have never read Romans 1-4 before, Mr Noisy Gong kept talking about a Dude named Jesus Christ in it, which I later found out was a letter written to the Romans rather than a personal letter written to me by some dude named Roman. At that point, I was like “Okay, fine, all in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour.”</p>

<p>Now, if you subscribe to a religion, which I do not, or you have yet to encounter God personally, perhaps due to learning whatever through doctrine written by some historical figures whose names are not on the No. 1 bestseller of humanity, then I would advise you to ask God with your heart to show you who He is. <strong>We won’t get anywhere unless we fix the immediate problem of people thinking you are nuts the moment you bring up the three-letter word <em>God</em>.</strong> Our inability to let each other finish our sentences and instinctive rejection of God are getting ridiculous and out of control.</p>

<p>A new friend of mine mentioned the following highlighted verse from the Book of Joel yesterday.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="joel-22732">Joel 2:27–32</h3>

<p>[27] You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,<br />
  and that I am the LORD your God and there is none else.<br />
 And my people shall never again be put to shame.</p>

<p>The LORD Will Pour Out His Spirit</p>

<p><strong>[28] “And it shall come to pass afterward,</strong><br />
      <strong>that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;</strong><br />
 <strong>your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</strong><br />
      <strong>your old men shall dream dreams,</strong><br />
      <strong>and your young men shall see visions.</strong><br />
 [29] Even on the male and female servants<br />
      in those days I will pour out my Spirit.</p>

<p>[30] “And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. [31] The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes. [32] And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>According to my half-assed ChatGPT research, Joel is one of the twelve minor prophets like Jonah, but Joel is not lucky enough to be included in all Abrahamic religions like Jonah. However, Isaiah and Ezekiel are both recognised in all Abrahamic religions, which I do not subscribe to. So here you go.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="isaiah-4418">Isaiah 44:1–8</h3>

<p>Israel the LORD’s Chosen</p>

<p>[1] “But now hear, O Jacob my servant,<br />
      Israel whom I have chosen!<br />
 [2] Thus says the LORD who made you,<br />
      who formed you from the womb and will help you:<br />
 Fear not, O Jacob my servant,<br />
      Jeshurun whom I have chosen.<br />
 [3] For I will pour water on the thirsty land,<br />
      and streams on the dry ground;<br />
 <strong>I will pour my Spirit upon your offspring,</strong><br />
      and my blessing on your descendants.<br />
 [4] They shall spring up among the grass<br />
      like willows by flowing streams.<br />
 [5] This one will say, ‘I am the LORD’s,’<br />
      another will call on the name of Jacob,<br />
 and another will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’<br />
      and name himself by the name of Israel.”</p>

<p>Besides Me There Is No God</p>

<p>[6] Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel<br />
      and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts:<br />
 “I am the first and I am the last;<br />
      besides me there is no god.<br />
 [7] Who is like me? Let him proclaim it.<br />
      Let him declare and set it before me,<br />
 since I appointed an ancient people.<br />
      Let them declare what is to come, and what will happen.<br />
 [8] Fear not, nor be afraid;<br />
      have I not told you from of old and declared it?<br />
      And you are my witnesses!<br />
 Is there a God besides me?<br />
      There is no Rock; I know not any.” (ESV)</p>

<h3 id="ezekiel-392529">Ezekiel 39:25–29</h3>

<p>The LORD Will Restore Israel</p>

<p>[25] “Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for my holy name. [26] They shall forget their shame and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when they dwell securely in their land with none to make them afraid, [27] when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies’ lands, and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations. [28] Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, because I sent them into exile among the nations and then assembled them into their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore. <strong>[29] And I will not hide my face anymore from them, when I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.”</strong> (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>I inquired about Him once in the first 27 years of my life, and He showed up five weeks later. Do you dare to have a go? I dare you, bitch.</p>

<p>I use the word <strong>bitch</strong> to describe anyone who is unfaithful. I was a bitch myself back when I did not have faith. I am still a bitch sometimes especially when I’m late to meet my new friend for over half an hour.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="malachi-3615">Malachi 3:6–15</h2>

<p>Robbing God</p>

<p>[6] “For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed. [7] From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, ‘How shall we return?’ [8] Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. [9] You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. <strong>[10] Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.</strong> [11] I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts. [12] Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p><strong>[13] “Your words have been hard against me, says the LORD. But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’ [14] You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God. What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the LORD of hosts? [15] And now we call the arrogant blessed. Evildoers not only prosper but they put God to the test and they escape.’”</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="matthew-62534">Matthew 6:25–34</h2>

<p>Do Not Be Anxious</p>

<p>[25] “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. <strong>[33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</strong></p>

<p><strong>[34] “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="leviticus-26113">Leviticus 26:1–13</h2>

<p>Blessings for Obedience</p>

<p>[1] “You shall not make idols for yourselves or erect an image or pillar, and you shall not set up a figured stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the LORD your God. [2] You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</p>

<p><strong>[3] “If you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them, [4] then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. [5] Your threshing shall last to the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last to the time for sowing. And you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely.</strong> [6] I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. And I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land. [7] You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. [8] Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. [9] I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will confirm my covenant with you. [10] You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new. [11] I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you. [12] And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people. [13] I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="ezekiel-362232">Ezekiel 36:22–32</h2>

<p>I Will Put My Spirit Within You</p>

<p>[22] “Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. [23] And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. [24] I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land. <strong>[25] I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. [26] And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. [27] And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.</strong> [28] You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. [29] And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. And I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you. [30] I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. [31] Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations. [32] It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="deuteronomy-101222">Deuteronomy 10:12–22</h2>

<p>Circumcise Your Heart</p>

<p><strong>[12] “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, [13] and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD, which I am commanding you today for your good? [14] Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it. [15] Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day. [16] Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.</strong> [17] For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. [18] He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. [19] Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. [20] You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear. [21] He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen. [22] Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="proverbs-102123">Proverbs 10:21–23</h2>

<p>[21] The lips of the righteous feed many,<br />
      but fools die for lack of sense.<br />
 <strong>[22] The blessing of the LORD makes rich,</strong><br />
      <strong>and he adds no sorrow with it.</strong><br />
 [23] Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool,<br />
      but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="ecclesiastes-5820">Ecclesiastes 5:8–20</h2>

<p>The Vanity of Wealth and Honor</p>

<p>[8] If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them. [9] But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.</p>

<p><strong>[10] He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.</strong> [11] When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? [12] Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.</p>

<p>[13] There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, [14] and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. [15] As he came from his mother’s womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. [16] This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind? [17] Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.</p>

<p>[18] Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. [19] Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—this is the gift of God. [20] For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="1-timothy-6610">1 Timothy 6:6–10</h2>

<p>[6] But godliness with contentment is great gain, [7] for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. [8] But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. [9] But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. <strong>[10] For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="luke-121315">Luke 12:13–15</h2>

<p>The Parable of the Rich Fool</p>

<p>[13] Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” [14] But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” <strong>[15] And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="2-corinthians-969">2 Corinthians 9:6–9</h2>

<p>The Cheerful Giver</p>

<p>[6] The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. [7] Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. <strong>[8] And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.</strong> [9] As it is written,</p>

<p>“He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;<br />
      his righteousness endures forever.” (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="matthew-61924">Matthew 6:19–24</h2>

<p>Lay Up Treasures in Heaven</p>

<p><strong>[19] “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, [20] but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. [21] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</strong></p>

<p>[22] “The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, [23] but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</p>

<p><strong>[24] “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="philippians-41020">Philippians 4:10–20</h2>

<p>God’s Provision</p>

<p>[10] I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. [11] Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned, in whatever situation I am, to be content. <strong>[12] I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. [13] I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</strong></p>

<p>[14] Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. [15] And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. [16] Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. [17] Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. <strong>[18] I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. [19] And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. [20] To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<p>任路人避一陣雨<br />
雨過後再未重遇<br />
我卻死心塌地 呆站在原處<br />
只有青春有甚麼可以輸</p>

<p>雨季走了突來暴雪<br />
雪再飄過換寒暑<br />
兩腳即使顫動 情緒卻鎖住<br />
一片忠心這是我的短處</p>

<p>耐性的比賽 像隻忠犬的愛<br />
長流細水編織典故方可以跨世代<br />
善良的車站 盡其一生替戀人乘載<br />
風雪我都依然觀賞尾班車開</p>

<p>被雪花淹蓋 蒙著兩眼看將來<br />
人潮暗湧一心找你充滿絕望和期待<br />
自殘式忍耐 歷遍春花秋葉從沒有悔改<br />
當你的芳蹤也石沉大海</p>

<p>背唱片店自言自語<br />
語氣輕似唸情書<br />
信有一千歲命 時間太充裕<br />
所有光陰押下我的賭注</p>

<p>耐性的比賽 像隻忠犬的愛<br />
長流細水編織典故方可以跨世代<br />
善良的車站 盡其一生替戀人乘載<br />
相信有生之年總可妄想天開</p>

<p>被雪花淹蓋 蒙著兩眼看將來<br />
人潮暗湧一心找你充滿絕望和期待<br />
自殘式忍耐 歷遍春花秋葉從沒有悔改<br />
會有歷史記載 令後代動容的愛</p>

<p>耐性的比賽 直到風光不再<br />
原來澀谷東急總店消失我都會在<br />
做遊客地標 讓每一位因為我等到所愛<br />
所以我等不來亦視為很應該</p>

<p>像潦倒乞丐 垂垂老矣也痴呆<br />
繁榮會死比不起我這故事更令別人無奈<br />
任誰勸喻移不開一千個萬年爭取一夕愛</p>

<p>自鳴年紀輕斗膽與愛競賽<br />
萬年後今天待旁觀者感慨<br />
