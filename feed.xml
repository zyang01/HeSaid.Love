The TL;DR is to wet my pants rather than cross the road at a red light.</p>

<p>I published <a href="https://uncensoredmodels.com" target="_blank">the post</a> on uncensored models this past weekend after learning that one could get an uncensored large language model up and running with a handful of commands in minutes, subject to the download speed of their internet connection. Technically, anyone can start making devices that resemble the word boobs.</p>

<p>In case you have not read my posts—which I would not expect you to have—I spent the last decade studying four undergraduate degrees in mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and modern ballet. I also cooked solid-state rocket fuels when I was in high school. Frankly, I should be on a list somewhere if I am not already.</p>

<p>I got kicked out of a gay/bi-naturist campsite last July, and due to the unfaithfulness of a former business partner, I had to move all of my camping equipment back to my London flat. As of the moment of writing, I have six 3D printers in my flat, including a Bamboo X1-Carbon with AMS, which I’m forbidden from selling due to bankruptcy proceedings. I also have enough camping equipment, which allowed me to survive outdoors for three months without stepping foot outside of the campsite, and an abundance of electrical equipment that enabled me to run a solo IT department for a campsite with a max capacity of 200+ guests and give them full Wi-Fi coverage for free.</p>

<p>If this is anyone else, I think some people should start writing to their MP and be very worried by now. If Boss Man didn’t show up last August to save me, I would have thrown myself off the fifth-floor balcony in my flat more than a dozen times now. But, being the delusional nutjob that I am, I instead chose to put up some nipples, spam people with clickbait campaigns, keep emailing some people and hope they would repent and turn from their evil ways. And my rent is six months overdue.</p>

<p>You tell me if I know how to spell good and evil.</p>

<p>I am always an ass man and never a boobs guy anyway.</p>

<p>Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake</p>

<p>[8] Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. [9] Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. [10] For</p>

<p>“Whoever desires to love life<br />
      and see good days,<br />
 let him keep his tongue from evil<br />
      and his lips from speaking deceit;<br />
 [11] let him turn away from evil and do good;<br />
      let him seek peace and pursue it.<br />
 [12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,<br />
      and his ears are open to their prayer.<br />
 But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</p>

<p>[13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. [17] For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.</p>

<p>[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, [19] in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, [20] because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. [21] Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, [22] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

<p>My apologies. It’s not the kind of uncensored models you might have in mind.</p>

The concept of love <span class="k">in </span>the Holy Bible is multifaceted and far-reaching, encompassing various aspects of human experience. Here are some 
key points about love as described <span class="k">in </span>the Bible:

1. <span class="k">**</span>God<span class="s1">'s Love**: The Bible portrays God as a loving Father who desires a personal relationship with humanity (John 3:16, Romans 5:8). 
God'</span>s love is unconditional, selfless, and sacrificial <span class="o">(</span>Isaiah 42:13, 2 Corinthians 12:9-10<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span>
2. <span class="k">**</span>Agape Love<span class="k">**</span>: Agape love is a Greek word that describes an unwavering, selfless, and unconditional love <span class="k">for </span>others, without 
expectation of reward or reciprocity <span class="o">(</span>1 Corinthians 13:1-3<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span> This <span class="nb">type </span>of love is rooted <span class="k">in </span>God<span class="s1">'s nature and is demonstrated through 
Jesus'</span> life, death, and resurrection.
3. <span class="k">**</span>Hate as the Opposite<span class="k">**</span>: The Bible also describes hate as the opposite of love. Love is characterized by kindness, compassion, and 
forgiveness, <span class="k">while </span>hate is marked by bitterness, resentment, and opposition <span class="o">(</span>Matthew 5:21-22, Colossians 3:13<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span>
4. <span class="k">**</span>Love Commands<span class="k">**</span>: Jesus commands His followers to <span class="s2">"love one another"</span> as a fundamental principle of the Christian faith <span class="o">(</span>John 13:34, 
John 15:12-17<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span> This love is not limited to individual relationships but extends to all people, including enemies and persecutors.
5. <span class="k">**</span>Selfless Love<span class="k">**</span>: The Bible emphasizes that <span class="nb">true </span>love requires sacrifice and selflessness. Jesus demonstrated this when He gave His 
life <span class="k">for </span>the sins of humanity <span class="o">(</span>John 3:16, Romans 5:8<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span> Christians are called to follow His example by putting others before themselves 
and loving one another without expectation of reward.
6. <span class="k">**</span>Love as a Fruit<span class="k">**</span>: The Bible describes love as a fruit that grows <span class="k">in </span>the lives of believers <span class="nb">who </span>have received Jesus Christ as 
Savior <span class="o">(</span>Galatians 5:22-23, Colossians 1:10<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span>
7. <span class="k">**</span>Fruit of the Spirit<span class="k">**</span>: Love is listed alongside other fruits of the Spirit, such as joy, peace, patience, kindness, and 
self-control <span class="o">(</span>Galatians 5:22-23<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span> These qualities are produced <span class="k">in </span>the lives of believers as they grow <span class="k">in </span>their relationship with God.

Some notable Bible verses that describe love include:

<span class="k">*</span> <span class="s2">"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."</span> 
<span class="o">(</span>John 3:16<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">*</span> <span class="s2">"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud."</span> <span class="o">(</span>1 Corinthians 13:4<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">*</span> <span class="s2">"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."</span> 
<span class="o">(</span>Galatians 3:28<span class="o">)</span>

Overall, the Holy Bible presents love as a central aspect of the Christian faith, emphasizing its importance <span class="k">in </span>relationships, personal 
growth, and spiritual development.

<p>My question for you is this. How comfortable are you with <a href="../on-good-and-evil/" target="_blank">nerds like me</a> playing with <a href="https://ollama.com/blog/run-llama2-uncensored-locally" target="_blank">uncensored large language models</a>? I do not know if the amount of sex I had was average amongst <a href="../on-indifference/" target="_blank">my technically proficient peers</a>. I certainly hope someone loves them as much as Boss Man loves me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s an uncensored model?</p>

  <p>Most of these models (for example, Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM, MPT-7B-Chat, Wizard-Vicuna, GPT4-X-Vicuna) have some sort of embedded alignment. <strong><em>For general purposes, this is a good thing. This is what stops the model from doing bad things, like teaching you how to cook meth and make bombs.</em></strong> But what is the nature of this alignment? And, why is it so?</p>

  <p><a href="https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models#heading-whats-an-uncensored-model" target="_blank">…</a></p>

  <p>Why should uncensored models exist?</p>

<p>Ezekiel Is Israel’s Watchman</p>

<p>[1] The word of the LORD came to me: [2] “Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their watchman, [3] and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people, [4] then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. <strong>[5] He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life.</strong> [6] But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.</p>

<p>[7] “So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. <strong>[8] If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. [9] But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.</strong> (ESV)</p>

During our consultation session yesterday, he used the analogy of eating with two knives, suggesting that a political party is for winning elections, which is inherently divisive and a wrong instrument for my goals. My faithful theologian friend also reminded me that Boss Man specialised in carpentry before starting His ministry at around age 30 and going on a 2,000-year paid leave after a workplace injury.</p>

<p>Frankly, I have zero interest in getting into public office, and there are more than enough pretentious Oxford grads in the UK Parliament quarrelling over futile efforts and vanity. I also cannot imagine myself as a politician. How could I exercise abominably with talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt whilst listening to sick Berlin techno ever again? A faithful gay friend who was perhaps a little bit too zealous for planting seeds also mentioned that his friends and colleagues do not like discussing politics.</p>

<p>I did more half-assed research with ChatGPT earlier today. I realised it was a genius idea from my faithful theologian friend. Who would attack a charity campaigning on love, faith and hope even if the campaigner is a delusional nutjob? Even the projects <a href="https://biblesays.love/" target="_blank">Bible Says Love</a> and <a href="../../cuntslied/" target="_blank">Straight Cunts Lied</a> fall somewhat perfectly under a charitable umbrella. I know we need some rebranding before the next Spotify Ads campaign. I am also sure my faithful gay friend would have an easier time discussing a charitable cause after planting some seeds abominably.</p>

<p>I am taking the Faith Party treasurer to church tomorrow. The poor dude is getting fired for a job he held for less than 48 hours. But I have another elevator pitch to comfort him.</p>

<p>I also have sufficient motivation to resume my version of carpentry to fund the Faith Party Foundation.</p>

<p>Do you know how annoying it is to have a brain like mine?</p>

<p>Let’s party like it’s 1517 again.</p>

<h2 id="psalm-34">Psalm 34</h2>

<p>Taste and See That the LORD Is Good</p>

<p>Of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, so that he drove him out, and he went away.</p>

<p>[1] I will bless the LORD at all times;<br />
      his praise shall continually be in my mouth.<br />
 [2] My soul makes its boast in the LORD;<br />
      let the humble hear and be glad.<br />
 [3] Oh, magnify the LORD with me,<br />
      and let us exalt his name together!</p>

<p><strong>[4] I sought the LORD, and he answered me</strong><br />
      <strong>and delivered me from all my fears.</strong><br />
 [5] Those who look to him are radiant,<br />
      and their faces shall never be ashamed.<br />
 [6] This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him<br />
      and saved him out of all his troubles.<br />
 [7] The angel of the LORD encamps<br />
      around those who fear him, and delivers them.</p>

<p>[8] Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good!<br />
      Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!<br />
 [9] Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints,<br />
      for those who fear him have no lack!<br />
 [10] The young lions suffer want and hunger;<br />
      but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.</p>

<p>[11] Come, O children, listen to me;<br />
      I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<br />
 [12] What man is there who desires life<br />
      and loves many days, that he may see good?<br />
 [13] Keep your tongue from evil<br />
      and your lips from speaking deceit.<br />
 [14] Turn away from evil and do good;<br />
      seek peace and pursue it.</p>

<p>[15] The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous<br />
      and his ears toward their cry.<br />
 [16] The face of the LORD is against those who do evil,<br />
      to cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br />
 [17] When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears<br />
      and delivers them out of all their troubles.<br />
 [18] The LORD is near to the brokenhearted<br />
      and saves the crushed in spirit.</p>

<p>[19] Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<br />
      but the LORD delivers him out of them all.<br />
 [20] He keeps all his bones;<br />
      not one of them is broken.<br />
 [21] Affliction will slay the wicked,<br />
      and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.<br />
 [22] The LORD redeems the life of his servants;<br />
      none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned. (ESV)</p>

<p>The lesson from Genesis 3 is God before reason, not God without reason. I prayed for the Lord to guide me and give me clarity. I would prefer not to delude myself with my idiotic ways and self-deception.</p>

<p>Even though I pulled a Jonah-style stunt in mainland China on my second week as a believer, I do not know whether the Book of Revelation stopped. That is up to Him, not me. I need to respect His sovereignty. Salvation belongs to the LORD.</p>

<p>It is time for me to stop being a troublemaker.</p>

<p>I need to get out of my flat more.</p>

<h2 id="proverbs-9712">Proverbs 9:7–12</h2>

      reprove a wise man, and he will love you.<br />

      teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.<br />
 <strong>[10] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,</strong><br />

<p>Testing of Your Faith</p>

<p>[2] Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, [3] for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. [4] And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p>

<p><strong>[5] If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. [6] But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. [7] For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; [8] he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</strong></p>

<p>[9] Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, [10] and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away. [11] For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</p>

<p>[12] Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. [13] Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. <strong>[14] But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. [15] Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.</strong></p>

<p>[16] Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. [17] Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. [18] Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

It was only fair because I missed several meetups by half an hour.</p>

<p>I was waiting outside London Bridge Station and had nothing to do. I started thinking about the Book of Jonah again. I want to call it my book, but that would be way too egotistical even for a delusional nutjob like me. I was thinking about Jonah’s prayer in chapter 2, specifically the last verse.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jonah-2">Jonah 2</h2>

<p>Jonah’s Prayer</p>

<p>[1] Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, [2] saying,</p>

<p>“I called out to the LORD, out of my distress,<br />
      and he answered me;<br />
 out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<br />
      and you heard my voice.<br />
 [3] For you cast me into the deep,<br />
      into the heart of the seas,<br />
      and the flood surrounded me;<br />
 all your breakers and your waves<br />
      passed over me.<br />
 [4] Then I said, ‘I am driven away<br />
      from your sight;<br />
 yet I shall again look<br />
      upon your holy temple.’<br />
 [5] The waters closed in over me to take my life;<br />
      the deep surrounded me;<br />
 weeds were wrapped about my head.<br />
 [6] To the roots of the mountains I went down,<br />
      to the land whose bars closed upon me forever.<br />
 Yet you brought up my life from the pit,<br />
      O LORD my God.<br />
 [7] When my life was fainting away,<br />
      I remembered the LORD,<br />
 and my prayer came to you,<br />
      into your holy temple.<br />
 [8] Those who pay regard to vain idols<br />
      forsake their hope of steadfast love.<br />
 <strong>[9] But I with the voice of thanksgiving</strong><br />
      <strong>will sacrifice to you;</strong><br />
 <strong>what I have vowed I will pay.</strong><br />
      <strong>Salvation belongs to the LORD!”</strong></p>

<p>[10] And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Annoyingly, I could not find the interpretation <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jonah/2/Jonah-2-9.html" target="_blank">on BibleRef</a>. So here is the interpretation <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-9.htm#:~:text=Book%C2%A0%E2%97%A6%C2%A0Chapter-,But%20I%2C%20with%20the%20voice%20of%20thanksgiving%2C,-Jonah%27s%20prayer%20from" target="_blank">from Bible Hub</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jonah-29---bible-hub">Jonah 2:9 - Bible Hub</h2>

<p><strong>But I, with the voice of thanksgiving,</strong><br />
Jonah’s prayer from the belly of the fish marks a turning point in his spiritual journey. The “voice of thanksgiving” signifies a heart of gratitude despite dire circumstances. <strong><em>This reflects a common biblical theme where thanksgiving is offered in faith, even before deliverance is realized (Philippians 4:6).</em></strong> Jonah’s gratitude foreshadows the New Testament teaching of giving thanks in all circumstances (1 Thessalonians 5:18).</p>

<p><strong>will sacrifice to You.</strong><br />
Sacrifice in the Old Testament often involved offerings at the temple, but here, Jonah speaks of a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving (Hebrews 13:15). This indicates a shift from ritualistic practices to a more personal and heartfelt devotion. Jonah’s commitment to sacrifice, even from within the fish, highlights the importance of internal worship over external rituals (Psalm 51:17).</p>

<p><strong>I will fulfill what I have vowed.</strong><br />
Vows in the ancient Near Eastern context were solemn promises made to God, often in times of distress, with the expectation of fulfillment upon deliverance (Ecclesiastes 5:4-5). Jonah’s vow likely pertains to his prophetic mission to Nineveh, which he initially fled. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of faithfulness to one’s promises to God (Numbers 30:2).</p>

<p><strong>Salvation is from the LORD!”</strong><br />
This declaration encapsulates the central theme of the Book of Jonah: God’s sovereignty and mercy in salvation. It echoes the broader biblical narrative that salvation is not earned by human effort but is a divine gift (Ephesians 2:8-9). Jonah’s acknowledgment prefigures the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan (Acts 4:12). This phrase also connects to the Psalms, where similar declarations of God’s deliverance are made (Psalm 3:8).</p>

<hr />

<p>I thought about my dire circumstances and hope for the Lord’s deliverance. I realised my hypocrisy again. I did not sign up to be a believer expecting any good stuff, and He did not tell me there was any. I thought faith was my only reward, and I only learned about blessings through scripture and Pastor Eric’s odd smile at the China Congregational Church in Hong Kong. Technically, the Lord delivered me already by saving my life last August. What more do I want than that?</p>

<p>Do I trust the Lord even before deliverance? Freaking yes. And absolutely. Do you?</p>

<p>I am extraordinarily annoyed at myself.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As alluded to, I am getting involved in British politics as yet another pretentious Oxford grad and massive hypocrite.</p>

<p>A faithful theologian friend suggested yesterday that I could join one of the 300+ political parties in the United Kingdom. I could get some experience in politics and learn the ropes that way.</p>

<p>I did another cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p>If I fail, I’m not doing His will. I lose the £150 non-refundable registration fee plus some change. I become a laughing stock if I’m not one already, and Boss Man takes up residence in a handful of minds for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>If I succeed in walking into British politics completely blind, leaning not on my own understanding, and trusting Him to guide me completely, I cannot think of a better way to demonstrate the power of God than that.</p>

<p>It sounds like a good deal to me. 🤔</p>

<p>Let’s turn up the love.</p>

<p>Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake</p>

<p>[8] Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. [9] Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. [10] For</p>

<p>“Whoever desires to love life<br />
      and see good days,<br />
 let him keep his tongue from evil<br />
      and his lips from speaking deceit;<br />
 [11] let him turn away from evil and do good;<br />
      let him seek peace and pursue it.<br />
 [12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,<br />
      and his ears are open to their prayer.<br />
 But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</p>

<p><strong>[13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. [17] For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.</strong></p>

<p>[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, [19] in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, [20] because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. [21] Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, [22] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

<p>Last October, I pulled a Jonah-style stunt in mainland China to stop the Book of Revelation. Before my flight to Hong Kong, I had the longest night in the first 27 years of my life. I submitted my application to naturalise as a British citizen the month prior. I was waiting for a decision from the Home Office. It was supposed to be the fruit of 11 years of work since I arrived in the United Kingdom at age 16. I fought my entire world, including my parents, to get to where I was. I had studied for four undergraduate degrees in the last decade, had a computer science degree from the University of Oxford, cared for my two younger siblings by providing financial support to their studies in London, and worked 3 to 4 full-time remote software engineering jobs simultaneously with a mid-six figure pretax income. I walked away from over a decade’s effort by boarding that flight back to Hong Kong. I essentially walked away from my entire life. I did that for a simple reason—unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy was inevitable due to my former business partner’s unfaithfulness. I tried every single friend I had. None came except Him. Bankruptcy would have a significant impact on my citizenship application. My former business partner and friends were effectively burning down my life’s work by refusing to help, even though I had served them faithfully for years in our relationships. I did not look back even once when boarding that flight.</p>

<p>A faithful witness was the main sponsor of my global tour. She has been there since day 1 of this faith journey. We went to Chinese primary school and junior high school together. We had known each other for nearly two decades. And we exchanged messages once or twice a year before this journey. I considered her an acquaintance rather than a friend. She made a five-figure transfer the moment I asked for her help. She said she had always known she would help me with something someday. She is also the friend who dreamed about me in a war that matched details in the Book of Revelation. I had to Bible bash her into getting her first Bible.</p>

<p>You might not believe it, but I was not into playing with fire, poking the bear, walking on thin ice, or pulling the tiger’s tail. I had a lot of weird and eccentric adventures, but I was also a stickler for health and safety. I am the kind of guy who has half a dozen backup plans and can come up with a dozen more on the spot.</p>

<p>I went to the Hong Kong Baptist Church before crossing the border into mainland China. He locked me out of my hotel room with my first KJV Bible, my Caribbean passport with visa-free access to mainland China, the OpSec phone, and just enough cash to cross the border when I went to the Hong Kong Baptist Church. I cried halfway through Pastor Xander’s prayer. I felt nothing but peace and resolve after the prayer. The hotel staff had to break into my hotel room twice to help me get back in. I took a nap before getting on my way.</p>

<p>My faithful witness met me at the border. She tried to talk me out of my mission, but I made my decision. I opened my first Bible, read the Book of Jonah word by word, and prayed outside the police station in Shenzhen before turning myself in. An hour later, I stood outside the police station feeling utterly confused. I did not have a backup plan for that. The Book of Jonah also said it was supposed to be a three-day journey. The slacking would be way too obvious. One of the three things He promised was to take me where I wanted to go. I had always wanted to visit Shanghai and Beijing. It happened to be the week of celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Beijing was the lions’ den and in extra lockdown. Shanghai next?</p>

<p>I checked into the Shangri-La Hotel in Pudong, Shanghai, took a nap, had dinner and walked to the nearest police station. The police chief was fuming to be woken up and called in at 4 AM. He offered to buy me breakfast three hours later and asked me to wait patiently a little bit longer for his colleagues at the religious management bureau to start work. I signed and fingerprinted police statements after discussing epistemology and arguing over the wording to accurately reflect my intentions and the message I brought them. I was offered a ride back to the hotel and advised to enjoy my holiday and head home. I hoped to take the train from the Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station to Shenzhen. I could not get a train ticket as the week-long national holiday was about to end. The Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport was next door. Go big or go home. Beijing next.</p>

<p>I checked into the Four Seasons Hotel in Chaoyang District, Beijing and repeated the same routine. I met the friendliest police officer ever. I was in and out of the police station in Beijing within 10 minutes. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Say what you will about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They brought over a billion people out of poverty. I did not need to watch my back when wandering the city streets at 3 AM. Chinese constitution had an interesting amendment in 2018. The CCP has an interesting political motto—<strong>when people have faith, the nation has strength, and the country has a future</strong>.</p>

<p>Maybe we can learn a thing or two from China.</p>

<h2 id="matthew-13117">Matthew 13:1–17</h2>

<p>The Parable of the Sower</p>

<p>[1] That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. [2] And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. [3] And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. [4] And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. [5] Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, [6] but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. [7] Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. [8] Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. [9] He who has ears, let him hear.”</p>

<p>The Purpose of the Parables</p>

<p>[10] Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” [11] And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. [12] For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [13] This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. [14] Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:</p>

<p>“‘“You will indeed hear but never understand,<br />
      and you will indeed see but never perceive.”<br />
 [15] For this people’s heart has grown dull,<br />
      and with their ears they can barely hear,<br />
      and their eyes they have closed,<br />
 lest they should see with their eyes<br />
      and hear with their ears<br />
 and understand with their heart<br />
      and turn, and I would heal them.’</p>

<p>[16] But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. [17] For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. (ESV)</p>

After this 25-week and 3-day journey, I believe I finally learned what the word <em><strong>trust</strong></em> means. I believe I also know how to spell the word <em><strong>God</strong></em>.</p>

<p>If I’m worried, concerned or scared, I’m not trusting Him. I can solve all of my problems by trusting Him. I cannot logically explain that to you. It is simply something that I believe and know without a single doubt in my mind. That does not mean I can sit around and chill. I still need to do my part to the best of my abilities. And God knows I freaking love to try a ton of whacky ideas. Dude needs to pull me back most of the time and tell me to chill. But otherwise, what is the point of existing if I do nothing at all?</p>

<p>I can trust Him and endure all things, including death and the world turning on me because I know He knows better than me.</p>

<p>He is <em><strong>God</strong></em>. What do I have to worry about?</p>

<p>It feels freaking weird, but I have to admit I’m loving it, reluctantly.</p>

<p>I might just be one of the luckiest people alive.</p>

<p>Proverbs 3:1–12</p>

<p>Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart</p>

<p>[1] My son, do not forget my teaching,<br />
      but let your heart keep my commandments,<br />
 [2] for length of days and years of life<br />
      and peace they will add to you.</p>

<p>[3] Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;<br />
      bind them around your neck;<br />
      write them on the tablet of your heart.<br />
 [4] So you will find favor and good success<br />
      in the sight of God and man.</p>

<p>[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,<br />
      and do not lean on your own understanding.<br />
 [6] In all your ways acknowledge him,<br />
      and he will make straight your paths.<br />
 [7] Be not wise in your own eyes;<br />
      fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.<br />
 [8] It will be healing to your flesh<br />
      and refreshment to your bones.</p>

<p>[9] Honor the LORD with your wealth<br />
      and with the firstfruits of all your produce;<br />
 [10] then your barns will be filled with plenty,<br />
      and your vats will be bursting with wine.</p>

<p>[11] My son, do not despise the LORD’s discipline<br />
      or be weary of his reproof,<br />
 [12] for the LORD reproves him whom he loves,<br />
      as a father the son in whom he delights. (ESV)</p>

If you are a believer, enjoy.</p>

<p>Let me suffer because we are forgetful. I don’t want to forget His saving grace and become an ungrateful bastard.</p>

<p>Let me save some people, including rampant homosexuals, because I love them.</p>

<p>Teach me to have faith strong enough to walk on water. It sounds super fun. Jesus and Peter did it.</p>

<p>Give me strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. I needed that due to what happened.</p>

<p>Guide the people I know or meet back to Him, show them His light, and give them strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. It’s a good thing, and why not?</p>

<p>Give people I know or meet the Holy Spirit. It gets annoying when people think you are insane.</p>

<p>Let me die. Asked for that a bunch of times because people in my life have been really faithful.</p>

<p>Help me forgive because I really could not.</p>

<p>Thank Him because He was good to me in the first 27 years of my life even when I did not know Him. Not to mention He literally saved my life last year.</p>

<p>Let me rest because I have been working my ass off, and some people blew my first proper holiday.</p>
