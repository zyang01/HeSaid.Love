Dude made me feel more loved in a week than anyone, including my parents, ever managed to make me feel my entire life combined. It might not be a beautiful testimony (yet), but it&apos;s a truthful testimony. I believe since 22 September 2024. Zeal for His house consumes me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have done everything out of &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/on-love&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and I sincerely wish my love could be more patient under normal circumstances, but unfortunately, we are &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letter.hesaid.love&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;running out of time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT take my words at face value.&lt;/b&gt; Trust, but verify. He is the way, and the truth, and the life. Ask Him, not me. I lean not on my own understanding. But reason within the boundaries and understanding He gives me.  I do not seek to condemn, even though telling the truth could easily be interpreted as such.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire in hell would be warmer than the coldness I felt in this world. How about you do your part, I do mine, Boss Man does His and let&apos;s find out on the other side what we are?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Say what I want by telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth feels as good as getting fucked in the ass by talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt for 4hrs+ non-stop whilst listening to sick Berlin techno. I intend to continue doing both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">On Money and Fiscal Policy</title><link href="https://hesaid.love/posts/on-money-and-fiscal-policy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Money and Fiscal Policy" /><published>2025-03-17T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-17T09:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hesaid.love/posts/on-money-and-fiscal-policy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hesaid.love/posts/on-money-and-fiscal-policy/"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first of a series of policy posts as I prepare to register a political party in Great Britain. I intend to apply the principles in my personal life where applicable. Someone has got to start walking in His statutes, observing His commandments, and doing them.</p>

<p>If you like to doubt, which is understandable given that we are all human and imperfect, I would like to paraphrase Boss Man by saying, “Go and learn what this means: ‘He is the Lord our <strong><em>God</em></strong>.’”</p>

<p>If you are a “believer” who “thinks” I have gone batshit crazy, then please consider whether trust and belief are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation" target="_blank">transitive</a> and whether you truly believe if you consider me nuts. I would also strongly encourage you to take a revision course on the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Hebrews%2011%3A1" target="_blank">definition of faith</a> outlined in Hebrews 11. We should stop this wishy-washy nonsense, and you are either in or you are out. No more foot in both camps bullshit.</p>

<h2 id="leviticus-26113">Leviticus 26:1–13</h2>

<p>Blessings for Obedience</p>

<p>[1] “You shall not make idols for yourselves or erect an image or pillar, and you shall not set up a figured stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the LORD your God. [2] You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</p>

<p><strong>[3] “If you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them, [4] then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. [5] Your threshing shall last to the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last to the time for sowing. And you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely.</strong> [6] I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. And I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land. [7] You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. [8] Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. [9] I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will confirm my covenant with you. [10] You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new. [11] I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you. [12] And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people. [13] I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="ezekiel-362232">Ezekiel 36:22–32</h2>

<p>I Will Put My Spirit Within You</p>

<p>[22] “Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. [23] And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. [24] I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land. <strong>[25] I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. [26] And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. [27] And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.</strong> [28] You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. [29] And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. And I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you. [30] I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. [31] Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations. [32] It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="deuteronomy-101222">Deuteronomy 10:12–22</h2>

<p>Circumcise Your Heart</p>

<p><strong>[12] “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, [13] and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD, which I am commanding you today for your good? [14] Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it. [15] Yet the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day. [16] Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.</strong> [17] For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. [18] He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. [19] Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. [20] You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear. [21] He is your praise. He is your God, who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen. [22] Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="proverbs-102123">Proverbs 10:21–23</h2>

<p>[21] The lips of the righteous feed many,<br />
      but fools die for lack of sense.<br />
 <strong>[22] The blessing of the LORD makes rich,</strong><br />
      <strong>and he adds no sorrow with it.</strong><br />
 [23] Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool,<br />
      but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="ecclesiastes-5820">Ecclesiastes 5:8–20</h2>

<p>The Vanity of Wealth and Honor</p>

<p>[8] If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them. [9] But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.</p>

<p><strong>[10] He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.</strong> [11] When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? [12] Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.</p>

<p>[13] There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, [14] and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. [15] As he came from his mother’s womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. [16] This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind? [17] Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.</p>

<p>[18] Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot. [19] Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—this is the gift of God. [20] For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="1-timothy-6610">1 Timothy 6:6–10</h2>

<p>[6] But godliness with contentment is great gain, [7] for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. [8] But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. [9] But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. <strong>[10] For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="luke-121315">Luke 12:13–15</h2>

<p>The Parable of the Rich Fool</p>

<p>[13] Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” [14] But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” <strong>[15] And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="2-corinthians-969">2 Corinthians 9:6–9</h2>

<p>The Cheerful Giver</p>

<p>[6] The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. [7] Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. <strong>[8] And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.</strong> [9] As it is written,</p>

<p>“He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;<br />
      his righteousness endures forever.” (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="matthew-624">Matthew 6:24</h2>

<p><strong>[24] “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="matthew-62534">Matthew 6:25–34</h2>

<p>Do Not Be Anxious</p>

<p>[25] “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. <strong>[33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</strong></p>

<p><strong>[34] “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="philippians-41020">Philippians 4:10–20</h2>

<p>God’s Provision</p>

<p>[10] I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. [11] Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned, in whatever situation I am, to be content. <strong>[12] I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. [13] I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</strong></p>

<p>[14] Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. [15] And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. [16] Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. [17] Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. <strong>[18] I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. [19] And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. [20] To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="malachi-3615">Malachi 3:6–15</h2>

<p>Robbing God</p>

<p>[6] “For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed. [7] From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. But you say, ‘How shall we return?’ [8] Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. [9] You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. <strong>[10] Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.</strong> [11] I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts. [12] Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p><strong>[13] “Your words have been hard against me, says the LORD. But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’ [14] You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God. What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the LORD of hosts? [15] And now we call the arrogant blessed. Evildoers not only prosper but they put God to the test and they escape.’”</strong> (ESV)</p>

<p>任路人避一陣雨<br />
雨過後再未重遇<br />
我卻死心塌地 呆站在原處<br />
只有青春有甚麼可以輸</p>

<p>雨季走了突來暴雪<br />
雪再飄過換寒暑<br />
兩腳即使顫動 情緒卻鎖住<br />
一片忠心這是我的短處</p>

<p>耐性的比賽 像隻忠犬的愛<br />
長流細水編織典故方可以跨世代<br />
善良的車站 盡其一生替戀人乘載<br />
風雪我都依然觀賞尾班車開</p>

<p>被雪花淹蓋 蒙著兩眼看將來<br />
人潮暗湧一心找你充滿絕望和期待<br />
自殘式忍耐 歷遍春花秋葉從沒有悔改<br />
當你的芳蹤也石沉大海</p>

<p>背唱片店自言自語<br />
語氣輕似唸情書<br />
信有一千歲命 時間太充裕<br />
所有光陰押下我的賭注</p>

<p>耐性的比賽 像隻忠犬的愛<br />
長流細水編織典故方可以跨世代<br />
善良的車站 盡其一生替戀人乘載<br />
相信有生之年總可妄想天開</p>

<p>被雪花淹蓋 蒙著兩眼看將來<br />
人潮暗湧一心找你充滿絕望和期待<br />
自殘式忍耐 歷遍春花秋葉從沒有悔改<br />
會有歷史記載 令後代動容的愛</p>

<p>耐性的比賽 直到風光不再<br />
原來澀谷東急總店消失我都會在<br />
做遊客地標 讓每一位因為我等到所愛<br />
所以我等不來亦視為很應該</p>

<p>像潦倒乞丐 垂垂老矣也痴呆<br />
繁榮會死比不起我這故事更令別人無奈<br />
任誰勸喻移不開一千個萬年爭取一夕愛</p>

<p>自鳴年紀輕斗膽與愛競賽<br />
萬年後今天待旁觀者感慨<br />

I downed several cups of coffee, which are considered luxury goods for me nowadays. It has been weeks since I had my favourite vanilla latte with coconut milk.</p>

<p>I spent two and a half hours teaching secondary school students at my table how to cheat their A-Level exams by building up muscle memory using past papers and mark schemes. I also shared my concerns about Artificial Intelligence on both the economic impact and national security. My local representative in parliament has done his homework on the subject, and he used the example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_horse_manure_crisis_of_1894" target="_blank">Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894</a> in London to reassure me that there was no need to panic. I responded bitterly with the throw-the-dice and see who was right in the end analogy. I was not brave enough to pull out the I-have-confirmation-from-the-Holy-Spirit card since my local MP took his Oath on a <a href="#jps-vs-kjv">JPS Bible</a>.</p>

<p>If this was the old me, I would have called it a day and told myself not to worry too much since I most likely got it wrong. And I should leave the matter to people who know what they are doing. I also asked if there was a chance to volunteer for events since I enjoyed being a bad influence and teaching secondary students how to cheat, as well as bitching and moaning about the Home Office caseworkers with other local constituents who are also first-generation immigrants.</p>

<p>I felt somewhat deflated after the event and wondered whether I had indeed gone batshit crazy given my recent pattern of behaviour and how understandably it could be interpreted as such by anyone who does not bother with the context. I asked the Lord for guidance on my walk back home.</p>

<p>Earlier this morning, I got rather annoyed again when I was in the shower doing unspeakable things. The following cost-benefit analysis appeared in my head.</p>

<p>If I got it wrong, what is the worst-case scenario? I become a laughing stock and maybe get my 30 seconds of fame by <a href="../on-legislature/" target="_blank">shouting God and love</a> at the world. Boss Man would take up residence in a handful of minds for 30 seconds. I am already <a href="../on-sexual-theology/" target="_blank">90% there</a> on being a laughing stock.</p>

<p>If I got it right, then I keep my clear conscience before God when <a href="https://letter.hesaid.love/" target="_blank">shit hits the fan</a>, and I get to say bitch, I told you so.</p>

<p>The annoying part? I realised He set me up by giving me the <a href="../on-gethsemane/" target="_blank">thought experiment</a> to test pastors and theologians. And I already made my choice when I pulled that <a href="../reasoning-behind-preaching-mainland-china-jonah-style/" target="_blank">stunt</a> in mainland China last October.</p>

<p>I do not know what Jonah’s vow was, but I know what my vow was.</p>

<p>I need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_exposed_person" target="_blank">expose myself</a> a bit more.</p>

<h2 id="jonah-2">Jonah 2</h2>

<p>Jonah’s Prayer</p>

<p>[1] Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, [2] saying,</p>

<p>“I called out to the LORD, out of my distress,<br />
      and he answered me;<br />
 out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<br />
      and you heard my voice.<br />
 [3] For you cast me into the deep,<br />
      into the heart of the seas,<br />
      and the flood surrounded me;<br />
 all your breakers and your waves<br />
      passed over me.<br />
 [4] Then I said, ‘I am driven away<br />
      from your sight;<br />
 yet I shall again look<br />
      upon your holy temple.’<br />
 [5] The waters closed in over me to take my life;<br />
      the deep surrounded me;<br />
 weeds were wrapped about my head.<br />
 [6] To the roots of the mountains I went down,<br />
      to the land whose bars closed upon me forever.<br />
 Yet you brought up my life from the pit,<br />
      O LORD my God.<br />
 [7] When my life was fainting away,<br />
      I remembered the LORD,<br />
 and my prayer came to you,<br />
      into your holy temple.<br />
 [8] Those who pay regard to vain idols<br />
      forsake their hope of steadfast love.<br />
 <b>[9] But I with the voice of thanksgiving<br />
      will sacrifice to you;<br />
 what I have vowed I will pay.<br />
      Salvation belongs to the LORD!”</b><br /></p>

<p>[10] And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-6417">Isaiah 64:1–7</h2>

<p>[1] Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down,<br />
      that the mountains might quake at your presence—<br />
 [2] as when fire kindles brushwood<br />
      and the fire causes water to boil—<br />
 to make your name known to your adversaries,<br />
      and that the nations might tremble at your presence!<br />
 [3] When you did awesome things that we did not look for,<br />
      you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.<br />
 [4] From of old no one has heard<br />
      or perceived by the ear,<br />
 no eye has seen a God besides you,<br />
      who acts for those who wait for him.<br />
 [5] You meet him who joyfully works righteousness,<br />
      those who remember you in your ways.<br />
 Behold, you were angry, and we sinned;<br />
      in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?<br />
 [6] We have all become like one who is unclean,<br />
      and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.<br />
 We all fade like a leaf,<br />
      and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.<br />
 [7] There is no one who calls upon your name,<br />
      who rouses himself to take hold of you;<br />
 for you have hidden your face from us,<br />
      and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities. (ESV)<br /></p>

<p>If you did not attend the 2018 Keble Ball, then I just want to apologise for feeding potentially up to 1,500 pretentious Oxford grads when they were young, stupid and drunk during a summer night back in 2018. I was punished severely the following morning and got a hangover for the first time in my life. I was also craving badly for fish.</p>

The dude is super weird, does not have a phone and uses an Oyster card. I cannot be late for more than 20-30min of our agreed meeting time. And there is no backing out at the last minute.</p>

<p>Frankly, I might enjoy that way of life. I already got quite into self-hosting. Things stopped working one by one as I went broke. Friends first, then iCloud and 1Password, and now WhatsApp. The only reason why I still haven’t sold my iPhone is because of the various chat applications, including but not limited to WhatsApp and WeChat. I did not expect to share the Martin Luther meme in my treasured meme collection one day, but life stopped making sense last October. I stopped worrying about tomorrow and just took it day by day without any expectations.</p>

<p>After a recent realisation, I think true friends would make more than an effort to arrive on time. I have got an iPhone 15 Pro to sell.</p>

<p>The only issue is the dude went to a <a href="../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/" target="_blank">catholic</a> school.</p>

<h2 id="john-151217">John 15:12–17</h2>

<p>[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. [13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="matthew-62534">Matthew 6:25–34</h2>

<p>Do Not Be Anxious</p>

<p>[25] “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. [33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</p>

<p>[34] “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (ESV)</p>

I know I cheated a lot using Artificial Intelligence over the last 171 days, and my eccentricity is evident to anyone who knows me personally. I made the <a href="../../cuntslied/" target="_blank">open invitation</a> because He had much to say in the long-ass bestseller. But if the “Christians” I know spent half as much effort into learning about Him than procuring more <a href="../on-drug-money-addiction/" target="_blank">drugs</a>, we would be living in a not-so-shitty world right now. We <a href="../on-indifference/" target="_blank">blame each other</a> for this shitty world and spend zero effort in contributing our share to make things better.</p>

<p>I topped up $12 in my OpenAI account when launching the project <a href="https://biblesays.love/" target="_blank">Bible Says Love</a> three months ago. I even built a simple mechanism to prevent abuse. I worry unnecessarily too much.</p>

<p>All of the stereotypes I had about Christianity turned out to be wrong once I started reading the bestseller. It is the closest thing to <a href="../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/" target="_blank">magic</a> I had ever come across in the 28 years of my life. I am not proud to make the following statement. I’m merely stating a fact. And they seem useless now that I have the <em>Teacher</em> and the <em>Textbook</em> to learn from. I studied four undergraduate degrees in the last decade, specialising in mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy and modern ballet. Not a single book or research paper I read made me feel the truth cutting through my bones into my soul.</p>

<p>And no, Christianity is not a religion. Why would you call the truth a religion?</p>

<p>I will slap you with the bestseller if you inform me the truth is subjective in person.</p>

<p>I will spend the rest of today reflecting on my hypocritical lack of faith in the United Kingdom’s legislature.</p>

<p>I’m not being sarcastic this time.</p>

I spent nearly a decade trying to predict financial market price movement in the next second, and I declared bankruptcy five months ago.

<p>My name is Aaron. I’m a 28-year-old rampant homosexual currently residing in Barnet, London. In the last decade, I have studied four undergraduate degrees in the United Kingdom, including mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and modern ballet. Less than 12 months ago, I worked remotely as a software engineer and consultant with a mid-six-figure pretax income. I single-handedly financially supported two adult younger siblings to study in London, paying overseas student fees.</p>

<p>I tried to take my first holiday in April last year at a gay/bi-naturist campsite in Peterborough. I ended up getting kicked out of the campsite three months later after giving them free full-site Wi-Fi coverage, declaring bankruptcy, and nearly throwing myself out of the fifth-floor balcony in my London home right in front of my younger sister.</p>

<p>I ordered a humanity’s bestseller on Amazon shortly after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite. Over the last 170 days, I travelled to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Macau, California, New York, Rome, Istanbul, Moscow, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I have also been sprinkling and potentially startling the nations via multiple Spotify Ads and email campaigns to warn the world of the socioeconomic tsunami brought about by Artificial Intelligence that we have never seen before in human history, which I believe will cause significant unemployment rates and global suffering for the bottom 90%. I consulted computer scientists from King’s College London and Imperial College London concerning my argument. Everyone was more pessimistic than I was.</p>

<p>Aside from the economic impact, my latest realisation over this past weekend involves national security. To briefly summarise my argument, anyone with the technical know-how to train a large language model can, in theory, construct dirty miniature devices by training their custom LLM or perhaps using one of the increasingly powerful open-source models on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz" target="_blank">Aaron Swartz’s hard drives</a>.</p>

<p>You can find more details on my blog HeSaidLove.com. I faithfully and truthfully documented my 170-day journey through 270+ posts. You will also find the draft manifesto for a new political party I intend to launch shortly in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><span id="shouting-love">I believe I’m supposed to bring you the following message.</span></p>

<p>Love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.</p>

  <p>If you are a <strong><em>stupid fucking idiot</em></strong> like <a href="../on-indifference/" target="_blank">this one</a>, or the word <strong><em>dictator</em></strong> is one of the words that shows up when I google your name, then <strong><em>this post is not for you</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I participated in a three-day event this past Friday to Sunday called <strong>Encounter</strong> with the Pentecostal church my welcoming party goes to. To repeat myself, some of the pastors and theologians I met in this 24-week and 1-day journey will call the mental health institutions nearby and tell them to bring a bus if they saw our worship.</p>

<p>On the train back to London yesterday morning, the scale of how truly fucked we are, dawned on me. You can watch my director’s cut New Millenium present to the world for a quick revision on the definition of fucked. I don’t have confirmation from the Holy Spirit on this, but it is logically simple enough for anyone with a semi-functioning reasoning faculty to understand it.</p>

<p>I hope the work I have shown in the 270+ posts written on this 169-day journey is sufficient to demonstrate the power of Artificial Intelligence. I have received no help from anyone except a handful of friends who financially supported me up to this point to the best of their abilities. I am forever grateful for their support, even if they had only bought me one coffee, and they are in the top 10% of taxpayers in the United Kingdom. If you remain sceptical that you will <a href="https://letter.hesaid.love/" target="_blank">lose your job within two years</a> due to Artificial Intelligence, then more proof will come as I embark on a new and exciting journey. That was confirmed by the Holy Spirit this morning, shortly before I started this post.</p>

<p>I will end this post by leaving you with the following thoughts. Anyone with the technical know-how to train a large language model, including idiots and people with the word dictator on the first page of Google search results using their name, can, in theory, construct stinkily dirty miniature devices by training their custom LLM or perhaps using one of the increasingly powerful open-source models on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz" target="_blank">Aaron Swartz’s hard drives</a>. They would need access to the key ingredients in my former colleague’s <a href="../on-acute-chemical-toxicity-uranium/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I hope she did not end up eating that cake.</p>

<p>If you are reading this post and from law enforcement, you can call King’s College London and confirm that I dropped out of my Physics and Philosophy undergraduate degree after only one term. My student number is 1580407. I tried building a device that required a power source more than a 9v battery last year. I ended up getting kicked out of a gay/bi-naturist campsite, declaring bankruptcy, and nearly throwing myself out of the fifth-floor balcony of my London home right in front of my younger sister. Feel free to email me if you struggle to find my home address for a welfare visit using your intelligence capabilities. Alternatively, you will soon be able to locate the address on a registration application to the Electoral Commission. I’m also on the electoral register.</p>

<p>The <a href="../on-sheep-and-goats/" target="_blank">ethical thought experiment</a> I designed during COVID-19 is still coming true. I’m going to bring Him back. Divine intervention has only just begun.</p>

<p>For the 27 years of my previous life, I had always considered myself an agnostic, and I was never once an atheist. I had no evidence for or against God’s existence, and even if He exists, God’s business is God’s business. I’m human, and I mind my own business. Then some people, including my former business partner, decided to fuck with my business, He decided to make my business His business, and now it’s time to fuck some people’s business up.</p>

<p>After much delay and trouble, the date on my certificate of naturalisation as a British citizen is 30 November 2024.</p>

<h2 id="romans-13810">Romans 13:8–10</h2>

<p>Fulfilling the Law Through Love</p>

<p>[8] Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. [9] For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [10] Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="luke-112932">Luke 11:29–32</h2>

<p>The Sign of Jonah</p>

<p>[29] When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. [30] For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. [31] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. [32] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-4219">Isaiah 42:1–9</h2>

<p>The LORD’s Chosen Servant</p>

<p>[1] Behold my servant, whom I uphold,<br />
  my chosen, in whom my soul delights;<br />
 I have put my Spirit upon him;<br />
  he will bring forth justice to the nations.<br />
 [2] He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice,<br />
  or make it heard in the street;<br />
 [3] a bruised reed he will not break,<br />
  and a faintly burning wick he will not quench;<br />
  he will faithfully bring forth justice.<br />
 [4] He will not grow faint or be discouraged<br />
  till he has established justice in the earth;<br />
  and the coastlands wait for his law.<br /></p>

<p>[5] Thus says God, the LORD,<br />
  who created the heavens and stretched them out,<br />
  who spread out the earth and what comes from it,<br />
 who gives breath to the people on it<br />
  and spirit to those who walk in it:<br />
 [6] “I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness;<br />
  I will take you by the hand and keep you;<br />
 I will give you as a covenant for the people,<br />
  a light for the nations,<br />
 [7]  to open the eyes that are blind,<br />
 to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,<br />
  from the prison those who sit in darkness.<br />
 [8] I am the LORD; that is my name;<br />
  my glory I give to no other,<br />
  nor my praise to carved idols.<br />
 [9] Behold, the former things have come to pass,<br />
  and new things I now declare;<br />
 before they spring forth<br />
  I tell you of them.” (ESV)<br /></p>

<h2 id="romans-3920">Romans 3:9–20</h2>

<p>No One Is Righteous</p>

<p>[9] What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, [10] as it is written:</p>

<p>“None is righteous, no, not one;<br />
 [11]  no one understands;<br />
  no one seeks for God.<br />
 [12] All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;<br />
  no one does good,<br />
  not even one.”<br />
 [13] “Their throat is an open grave;<br />
  they use their tongues to deceive.”<br />
 “The venom of asps is under their lips.”<br />
 [14]  “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”<br />
 [15] “Their feet are swift to shed blood;<br />
 [16]  in their paths are ruin and misery,<br />
 [17] and the way of peace they have not known.”<br />
 [18]  “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”<br /></p>

<p>[19] Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. [20] For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="ezekiel-222331">Ezekiel 22:23–31</h2>

<p>[23] And the word of the LORD came to me: [24] “Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation. [25] The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst. [26] Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. [27] Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain. [28] And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ when the LORD has not spoken. [29] The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice. [30] And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none. [31] Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.” (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-591421">Isaiah 59:14–21</h2>

<p>Judgment and Redemption</p>

<p>[14] Justice is turned back,<br />
  and righteousness stands far away;<br />
 for truth has stumbled in the public squares,<br />
  and uprightness cannot enter.<br />
 [15] Truth is lacking,<br />
  and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.<br /></p>

<p>The LORD saw it, and it displeased him<br />
  that there was no justice.<br />
 [16] He saw that there was no man,<br />
  and wondered that there was no one to intercede;<br />
 then his own arm brought him salvation,<br />
  and his righteousness upheld him.<br />
 [17] He put on righteousness as a breastplate,<br />
  and a helmet of salvation on his head;<br />
 he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,<br />
  and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak.<br />
 [18] According to their deeds, so will he repay,<br />
  wrath to his adversaries, repayment to his enemies;<br />
  to the coastlands he will render repayment.<br />
 [19] So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west,<br />
  and his glory from the rising of the sun;<br />
 for he will come like a rushing stream,<br />
  which the wind of the LORD drives.<br /></p>

<p>[20] “And a Redeemer will come to Zion,<br />
  to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,” declares the LORD.<br /></p>

<p>[21] “And as for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the LORD: “My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children’s offspring,” says the LORD, “from this time forth and forevermore.” (ESV)</p>

I also added the sentence about my not-yet-beautiful but truthful testimony, but that’s a topic for another day.</p>

<p>As mentioned in a previous post, I read the Book of Hebrews several weeks ago. After reading the following passage from Hebrews 11 and looking back at the crazy stunt I pulled in mainland China on my second week as a believer, I sincerely wish that it was just a coincidence and a crazy stunt I somehow managed to pull.</p>

<h2 id="hebrews-117">Hebrews 11:7</h2>

<p>[7] By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>I briefly explained my motives in previous posts. Even though I believed that going into mainland China for the three-day mission could potentially stop the Book of Revelation, I did not believe I alone could stop the Book of Revelation. I believed that He could stop the Book of Revelation, and all that I needed to do was to fulfil the prophecy of the sign of Jonah, just in case I was indeed the sign of Jonah given how much the Book of Jonah resonated with the story of my life. I could not in good conscience not go through with the stunt and let the Book of Revelation take place considering the suffering and punishment described in the book. If you read my posts, you will know why I believe the Book of Revelation to be real and truthful. You are more than welcome to claim that all the evidence I presented was merely coincidences, but they are personally coincidental enough for me to take action regardless of the likelihood of what I believe will happen. I would take that leap of faith as long as there is a non-zero probability to avoid it all. Wouldn’t you?</p>

<h2 id="jonah-3610">Jonah 3:6–10</h2>

<p>The People of Nineveh Repent</p>

<p>[6] The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. [7] And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh, “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water, [8] but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God. Let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. [9] Who knows? God may turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we may not perish.”</p>

<p>[10] When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>I asked a friend recently whether they believe I’m willing to lay down my life for them. They chose not to reply to that specific question. Back in early September of last year, I realised one evening that a friend of mine had gone radio silent for a couple of days and they weren’t picking up their phone. I decided to jump in an Uber and went to their parent’s house at midnight to make sure they were okay. No one answered the door that evening and I managed to leave a message by asking a neighbour for some pen and paper. Their parent informed me the following morning that they were having a rough time due to relationship issues. Another friend of mine recently informed me that the stunt I pulled in mainland China meant nothing since there is religious freedom in mainland China and Chinese law enforcement agencies are reasonable.</p>

[14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>In this faith journey of 23 weeks and 5 days, I learned that if I were to slip and break my neck in the shower today, there is only one person who would come for me and He is not in my WhatsApp or WeChat contacts. Frankly, I’m not even sure whether cutting my chest open, ripping my heart out, and placing it right in front of my WhatsApp and WeChat contacts would be sufficient to make them believe.</p>

<h2 id="hebrews-11">Hebrews 11</h2>

<p>By Faith</p>

<p>[1] Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. [2] For by it the people of old received their commendation. [3] By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.</p>

<p>[4] By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks. [5] By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. [6] And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. [7] By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</p>

<p>[8] By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. [9] By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. [10] For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God. [11] By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. [12] Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.</p>

<p>[13] These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. [14] For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. [15] If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. [16] But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</p>

<p>[17] By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, [18] of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [19] He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. [20] By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. [21] By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. [22] By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.</p>

<p>[23] By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. [24] By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, [25] choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. [26] He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. [27] By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. [28] By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.</p>

<p>[29] By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned. [30] By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. [31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.</p>

<p>[32] And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—[33] who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, [34] quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. [35] Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. [36] Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. [37] They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—[38] of whom the world was not worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</p>

<p>[39] And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised, [40] since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.

<h2 id="jonah-4">Jonah 4</h2>

<p>Jonah’s Anger and the LORD’s Compassion</p>

<p>[1] But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. [2] And he prayed to the LORD and said, “O LORD, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster. [3] Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.” [4] And the LORD said, “Do you do well to be angry?”</p>

<p>[5] Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city. [6] Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. [7] But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered. [8] When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.” [9] But God said to Jonah, “Do you do well to be angry for the plant?” And he said, “Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.” [10] And the LORD said, “You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night. [11] And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?” (ESV)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After literally working my ass off again by having another go at my adult webcam live-streaming career, only to finish the session early due to lack of audience probably due to terrible timing, the question of whether God has a sense of humour according to scripture showed up in my head.
