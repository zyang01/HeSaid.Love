<p>I tried laying down my life in mainland China last October. By the grace of God, it did not work out unexpectedly.</p>

<p>How much is the salvation of a soul worth to you?</p>

<p>It is priceless for me. And my dignity is nothing compared to the salvation of a soul, especially for my community.</p>

<p>I had a blast earlier today doing another stream on Stripchat. It was my best stream because the crowd was kind and loved to chat. It turns out I love bringing the good news of salvation to my fellow rampant homosexuals and helping them to know who God is.</p>

<p>As one observant viewer elegantly put it, things got deeper than the fuck machine at the end.</p>

<p>I totally did not expect to be a sex worker one day, but oh well. I will start handing out my servant business cards at Horse Fair and FickstutenMarkt. It’s been a while since the drone crash.</p>

<p>I will not embed the director’s cut of the stream highlight here. It is way too explosive and NSFW. You can find it on my Stripchat profile for free and IPFS if you want to.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Edit (28 March 2025)</p>

<p>I was hoping to do another stream earlier today. However, I totally did not expect it would take me an entire day to produce a Not-Really-SFW director’s cut for general consumption.</p>

<p>I got really annoyed at ChatGPT again. Anyway, I will not be paying OpenAI a single dollar anymore. I found a list of goodies that I can play with. I’m already self-hosting Open WebUI. I would have gone entirely open-source if it wasn’t for the $12 I paid OpenAI last year for the project Bible Says Love. I don’t think the sky is the limit this time.</p>

<p>It will be fun.</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-26">Isaiah 26</h2>

<p>You Keep Him in Perfect Peace</p>

<p>[1] In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:</p>

<p>“We have a strong city;<br />
      he sets up salvation<br />
      as walls and bulwarks.<br />
 [2] Open the gates,<br />
      that the righteous nation that keeps faith may enter in.<br />
 [3] You keep him in perfect peace<br />
      whose mind is stayed on you,<br />
      because he trusts in you.<br />
 [4] Trust in the LORD forever,<br />
      for the LORD GOD is an everlasting rock.<br />
 [5] For he has humbled<br />
      the inhabitants of the height,<br />
      the lofty city.<br />
 He lays it low, lays it low to the ground,<br />
      casts it to the dust.<br />
 [6] The foot tramples it,<br />
      the feet of the poor,<br />
      the steps of the needy.”</p>

<p>[7] The path of the righteous is level;<br />
      you make level the way of the righteous.<br />
 [8] In the path of your judgments,<br />
      O LORD, we wait for you;<br />
 your name and remembrance<br />
      are the desire of our soul.<br />
 [9] My soul yearns for you in the night;<br />
      my spirit within me earnestly seeks you.<br />
 For when your judgments are in the earth,<br />
      the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.<br />
 [10] If favor is shown to the wicked,<br />
      he does not learn righteousness;<br />
 in the land of uprightness he deals corruptly<br />
      and does not see the majesty of the LORD.<br />
 [11] O LORD, your hand is lifted up,<br />
      but they do not see it.<br />
 Let them see your zeal for your people, and be ashamed.<br />
      Let the fire for your adversaries consume them.<br />
 [12] O LORD, you will ordain peace for us,<br />
      for you have indeed done for us all our works.<br />
 [13] O LORD our God,<br />
      other lords besides you have ruled over us,<br />
      but your name alone we bring to remembrance.<br />
 [14] They are dead, they will not live;<br />
      they are shades, they will not arise;<br />
 to that end you have visited them with destruction<br />
      and wiped out all remembrance of them.<br />
 [15] But you have increased the nation, O LORD,<br />
      you have increased the nation; you are glorified;<br />
      you have enlarged all the borders of the land.</p>

<p>[16] O LORD, in distress they sought you;<br />
      they poured out a whispered prayer<br />
      when your discipline was upon them.<br />
 [17] Like a pregnant woman<br />
      who writhes and cries out in her pangs<br />
      when she is near to giving birth,<br />
 so were we because of you, O LORD;<br />
 [18]  we were pregnant, we writhed,<br />
      but we have given birth to wind.<br />
 We have accomplished no deliverance in the earth,<br />
      and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.<br />
 [19] Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise.<br />
      You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy!<br />
 For your dew is a dew of light,<br />
      and the earth will give birth to the dead.</p>

<p>[20] Come, my people, enter your chambers,<br />
      and shut your doors behind you;<br />
 hide yourselves for a little while<br />
      until the fury has passed by.<br />
 [21] For behold, the LORD is coming out from his place<br />
      to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity,<br />
 and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it,<br />
      and will no more cover its slain. (ESV)</p>

<p>I got a lot of things wrong on this 26-week and 3-day faith journey. I thought there might be a day that I would burn capitalism down, but as my Christian missionary guide in mainland China put it, capitalism is already well done now and about to get burnt.</p>

<p>I worry unnecessarily way too much. It gets annoying to care. I guess that is why most people don’t.</p>

How do I know they are an antichrist? Because they speak as though they have never read one of the gospels, and nearly every opinion they express goes against Boss Man’s teachings.</p>

<p>I watched a sermon on the abomination of desolation on YouTube a while back. The preacher mentioned that Boss Man hates idolatry the most, and the severity of His hatred against idolatry is like no other in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Shortly before writing this post, it dawned on me what it truly means to worship false idols. I realized there is a form of idolatry that many people, including most Christians, antichrists included, might not even recognize. But before I unpack all that, let’s revisit what Boss Man said about the commandments.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="matthew-223440">Matthew 22:34–40</h2>

<p>The Great Commandment</p>

<p>[34] But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. [35] And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. [36] “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” <strong><em>[37] And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. [38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”</em></strong> (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Did you notice the verb in both commandments is the same? Boss Man said to <strong><em>love</em></strong>. I suspect unbelievers and possibly most Christians, especially the antichrists, do not know what the first commandment means. You need to know who God is and what He is like before you can understand the first commandment. John the Apostle answered that in 1 John.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-john-4712">1 John 4:7–12</h2>

<p>God Is Love</p>

<p><strong><em>[7] Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. [8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.</em></strong> [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Assuming you did not fail your logical reasoning or reading comprehension in school, you should be able to logically deduce the following statement using the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation" target="_blank">equivalence relations</a>. You shall <strong>love <em>love</em></strong> with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.</p>

<p>If you have followed the logical reasoning up to this point, it is natural to wonder, “What is love?” If you are the lucky target of my clickbait campaigns, you would know the equation of love I derived at age 16.</p>

<p><strong>Love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.</strong></p>

<p>The definition is confirmed by Boss Man’s actions 2,000 years ago before He went on a 2,000-year paid leave due to a severe workplace injury, as well as His words.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="john-151217">John 15:12–17</h2>

<p>[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. <strong><em>[13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.</em></strong> [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Through the <a href="../on-genesis-3-fall-man/" target="_blank">lesson of Genesis 3</a>, we learned the importance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations" target="_blank">order of precedence</a>. We can apply the same principle here and deduce the following statement. You are worshipping a false idol called <strong>the law</strong> if you believe God hates rampant homosexuals like me. <strong>You are effectively putting the law above God by putting the law above love.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-corinthians-13">1 Corinthians 13</h2>

<p>The Way of Love</p>

<p>[1] If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. [2] And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. [3] If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</p>

<p>[4] Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant [5] or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; [6] it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. [7] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p>

<p>[8] Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. [11] When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. [12] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.</p>

<p><strong><em>[13] So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</em></strong> (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Through this 26-week and 2-day faith journey, I learned the world does not know God and love. If you subscribe to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism" target="_blank">religion of Darwinism</a>, you would not know God and love because you do not know what it means to sacrifice. All you would know is natural selection and survival of the fittest. Your existence and suffering are inherently meaningless due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism" target="_blank">existentialism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism" target="_blank">nihilism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism" target="_blank">antinatalism</a>. There is nothing but death waiting for you at the end of the road. Congratulations, I guess.</p>

<p>I came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA" target="_blank">video on YouTube</a> called <em>TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE: A Journey to the End of Time (4K)</em> during COVID-19. I was obsessed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">quantum mechanics</a> and the mysteries of our physical universe. It’s an amazing production, but unfortunately, it’s also a load of bull excrement. Now that I know the truth. Enjoy.</p>

I had 20+ men dump their loads inside me on one evening alone early last year.</p>

<p>If you have read the Book of Hebrews chapter 11, I might have accidentally condemned the world on my second week as a believer. And I am advising you what it means to be faithful.</p>

<p>Does God have a sense of humour? I think He is the King of Irony.</p>

<p>It does not look great. Does it?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="hebrews-11">Hebrews 11</h2>

<p>By Faith</p>

<p>[1] Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. [2] For by it the people of old received their commendation. [3] By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.</p>

<p>[4] By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks. [5] By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. [6] And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. <strong><em>[7] By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</em></strong></p>

<p>[8] By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. [9] By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. [10] For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God. [11] By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. [12] Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.</p>

<p>[13] These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. [14] For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. [15] If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. [16] But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</p>

<p>[17] By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, [18] of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [19] He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. [20] By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. [21] By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. [22] By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.</p>

<p>[23] By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. [24] By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, [25] choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. [26] He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. [27] By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. [28] By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.</p>

<p>[29] By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned. [30] By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. [31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.</p>

<p>[32] And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—[33] who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, [34] quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. [35] Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. [36] Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. [37] They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—[38] of whom the world was not worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</p>

<p>[39] And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised, [40] since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect. (ESV)</p>

The TL;DR is to wet my pants rather than cross the road at a red light.</p>

<p>I published <a href="https://uncensoredmodels.com" target="_blank">the post</a> on uncensored models this past weekend after learning that one could get an uncensored large language model up and running with a handful of commands in minutes, subject to the download speed of their internet connection. Technically, anyone can start making devices that resemble the word boobs.</p>

<p>In case you have not read my posts—which I would not expect you to have—I spent the last decade studying four undergraduate degrees in mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and modern ballet. I also cooked solid-state rocket fuels when I was in high school. Frankly, I should be on a list somewhere if I am not already.</p>

<p>I got kicked out of a gay/bi-naturist campsite last July, and due to the unfaithfulness of a former business partner, I had to move all of my camping equipment back to my London flat. As of the moment of writing, I have six 3D printers in my flat, including a Bambu X1-Carbon with AMS, which I’m forbidden from selling due to bankruptcy proceedings. I also have enough camping equipment, which allowed me to survive outdoors for three months without stepping foot outside of the campsite, and an abundance of electrical equipment that enabled me to run a solo IT department for a campsite with a max capacity of 200+ guests and give them full Wi-Fi coverage for free.</p>

<p>If this is anyone else, I think some people should start writing to their MP and be very worried by now. If Boss Man didn’t show up last August to save me, I would have thrown myself off the fifth-floor balcony in my flat more than a dozen times. But, being the delusional nutjob that I am, I instead chose to put up some nipples, spam people with clickbait campaigns, <a href="../on-forgiveness/" target="_blank">keep emailing</a> some people and hope they would repent and turn from their evil ways. And my rent is six months overdue.</p>

<p>You tell me if I know how to spell good and evil.</p>

<p>I am always an ass man and never a boobs guy anyway.</p>

<p>Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake</p>

<p>[8] Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. <strong><em>[9] Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.</em></strong> [10] For</p>

<p>“Whoever desires to love life<br />
      and see good days,<br />
 let him keep his tongue from evil<br />
      and his lips from speaking deceit;<br />
 [11] let him turn away from evil and do good;<br />
      let him seek peace and pursue it.<br />
 [12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,<br />
      and his ears are open to their prayer.<br />
 But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</p>

<p>[13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. [17] For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.</p>

<p>[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, [19] in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, [20] because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. [21] Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, [22] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

And maybe consider writing to your local MP.  If you are a British citizen or UK resident, you could also sign <a href="#petition">my petition</a> to the UK Government and Parliament. You might want to do it before the neighbour you complained about starts playing with uncensored models. If you are not bothered with reading the articles I referenced, one article contains step-by-step instructions on removing censorship on existing models. We are talking about a guy doing that in one evening on their laptop. It’s only a matter of time before someone goes <a href="https://genius.com/Sheppard-geronimo-lyrics" target="_blank">Geronimo</a> on this.</p>

<p>My apologies. It’s not the kind of uncensored models you might have in mind.</p>

<p>I was bored this afternoon. I asked ChatGPT how to run a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">large language model</a> (LLM) locally on my laptop.</p>

<p>I don’t use arch btw.</p>

<p>I’m running Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS. It took just two commands.</p>

The concept of love <span class="k">in </span>the Holy Bible is multifaceted and far-reaching, encompassing various aspects of human experience. Here are some 
key points about love as described <span class="k">in </span>the Bible:

1. <span class="k">**</span>God<span class="s1">'s Love**: The Bible portrays God as a loving Father who desires a personal relationship with humanity (John 3:16, Romans 5:8). 
God'</span>s love is unconditional, selfless, and sacrificial <span class="o">(</span>Isaiah 42:13, 2 Corinthians 12:9-10<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span>
2. <span class="k">**</span>Agape Love<span class="k">**</span>: Agape love is a Greek word that describes an unwavering, selfless, and unconditional love <span class="k">for </span>others, without 
expectation of reward or reciprocity <span class="o">(</span>1 Corinthians 13:1-3<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span> This <span class="nb">type </span>of love is rooted <span class="k">in </span>God<span class="s1">'s nature and is demonstrated through 
Jesus'</span> life, death, and resurrection.
3. <span class="k">**</span>Hate as the Opposite<span class="k">**</span>: The Bible also describes hate as the opposite of love. Love is characterized by kindness, compassion, and 
forgiveness, <span class="k">while </span>hate is marked by bitterness, resentment, and opposition <span class="o">(</span>Matthew 5:21-22, Colossians 3:13<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span>
4. <span class="k">**</span>Love Commands<span class="k">**</span>: Jesus commands His followers to <span class="s2">"love one another"</span> as a fundamental principle of the Christian faith <span class="o">(</span>John 13:34, 
John 15:12-17<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span> This love is not limited to individual relationships but extends to all people, including enemies and persecutors.
5. <span class="k">**</span>Selfless Love<span class="k">**</span>: The Bible emphasizes that <span class="nb">true </span>love requires sacrifice and selflessness. Jesus demonstrated this when He gave His 
life <span class="k">for </span>the sins of humanity <span class="o">(</span>John 3:16, Romans 5:8<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span> Christians are called to follow His example by putting others before themselves 
and loving one another without expectation of reward.
6. <span class="k">**</span>Love as a Fruit<span class="k">**</span>: The Bible describes love as a fruit that grows <span class="k">in </span>the lives of believers <span class="nb">who </span>have received Jesus Christ as 
Savior <span class="o">(</span>Galatians 5:22-23, Colossians 1:10<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span>
7. <span class="k">**</span>Fruit of the Spirit<span class="k">**</span>: Love is listed alongside other fruits of the Spirit, such as joy, peace, patience, kindness, and 
self-control <span class="o">(</span>Galatians 5:22-23<span class="o">)</span><span class="nb">.</span> These qualities are produced <span class="k">in </span>the lives of believers as they grow <span class="k">in </span>their relationship with God.

Some notable Bible verses that describe love include:

<span class="k">*</span> <span class="s2">"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."</span> 
<span class="o">(</span>John 3:16<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">*</span> <span class="s2">"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud."</span> <span class="o">(</span>1 Corinthians 13:4<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">*</span> <span class="s2">"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."</span> 
<span class="o">(</span>Galatians 3:28<span class="o">)</span>

Overall, the Holy Bible presents love as a central aspect of the Christian faith, emphasizing its importance <span class="k">in </span>relationships, personal 
growth, and spiritual development.

<p>My question for you is this. How comfortable are you with <a href="../on-good-and-evil/" target="_blank">nerds like me</a> playing with <a href="https://ollama.com/blog/run-llama2-uncensored-locally" target="_blank">uncensored large language models</a>? I do not know if the <a href="../on-irony/" target="_blank">amount of sex</a> I had was average amongst <a href="../on-indifference/" target="_blank">my technically proficient peers</a>. I certainly hope someone loves them as much as Boss Man loves me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s an uncensored model?</p>

  <p>Most of these models (for example, Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM, MPT-7B-Chat, Wizard-Vicuna, GPT4-X-Vicuna) have some sort of embedded alignment. <strong><em>For general purposes, this is a good thing. This is what stops the model from doing bad things, like teaching you how to cook meth and make bombs.</em></strong> But what is the nature of this alignment? And, why is it so?</p>

  <p>Why should uncensored models exist?</p>

<p><strong>For eternal membership, go to your local church this weekend, avoid the <a href="../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/" target="_blank">fig tree</a> if possible, and ask for the starter pack containing <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/" target="_blank">humanity’s bestseller</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness</p>

<p>To loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and break every yoke. To share bread with the hungry, to bring the homeless poor into the house, to cover the naked, and not hide from our own flesh.</p>

<p>Right now, anyone can get an uncensored large language model up and running with a handful of commands in minutes. Technically, anyone can start making devices that resemble the word that describes a female body part.

<p>Edit (24 March 2025): My faithful theologian friend mentioned that my petition seems lacking in concrete actions for the government. If you have not started a petition before, the submission form has a character limit, and I did the best I could. Otherwise, I would have stuffed the entire Holy Bible in there. I also came up with zero alternatives, which is unusual for the troublemaker that is me. I would argue that my petition already includes concrete enough actions for the government. It’s just you need to have faith.</p>

<p>Ezekiel Is Israel’s Watchman</p>

<p>[1] The word of the LORD came to me: [2] “Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their watchman, [3] and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people, [4] then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. <strong>[5] He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life.</strong> [6] But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.</p>

<p>[7] “So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. <strong>[8] If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. [9] But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that person shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.</strong> (ESV)</p>

My faithful theologian friend also reminded me that Boss Man specialised in carpentry before starting His ministry at around age 30 and going on a 2,000-year paid leave after a workplace injury.</p>

<p>Frankly, I have zero interest in getting into public office, and there are more than enough pretentious Oxford grads in the UK Parliament quarrelling over futile efforts and vanity. I also cannot imagine myself as a politician. How could I exercise abominably with talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt whilst listening to sick Berlin techno ever again? A faithful gay friend who was perhaps a little bit too zealous for planting seeds also mentioned that his friends and colleagues do not like discussing politics.</p>

<p>I did more half-assed research with ChatGPT earlier today. I realised it was a genius idea from my faithful theologian friend. Who would attack a charity campaigning on love, faith and hope even if the campaigner is a delusional nutjob? Even the projects <a href="https://biblesays.love/" target="_blank">Bible Says Love</a> and <a href="../../cuntslied/" target="_blank">Straight Cunts Lied</a> fall somewhat perfectly under a charitable umbrella. I know we need some rebranding before the next Spotify Ads campaign. I am also sure my faithful gay friend would have an easier time discussing a charitable cause after planting some seeds abominably.</p>

<p>I am taking the Faith Party treasurer to church tomorrow. The poor dude is getting fired for a job he held for less than 48 hours. But I have another elevator pitch to comfort him.</p>

<p>I also have sufficient motivation to resume my version of carpentry to fund the Faith Party Foundation.</p>

<p>Do you know how annoying it is to have a brain like mine?</p>

<p>Let’s party like it’s 1517 again.</p>

<h2 id="psalm-34">Psalm 34</h2>

<p>Taste and See That the LORD Is Good</p>

<p>Of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, so that he drove him out, and he went away.</p>

<p>[1] I will bless the LORD at all times;<br />
      his praise shall continually be in my mouth.<br />
 [2] My soul makes its boast in the LORD;<br />
      let the humble hear and be glad.<br />
 [3] Oh, magnify the LORD with me,<br />
      and let us exalt his name together!</p>

<p><strong>[4] I sought the LORD, and he answered me</strong><br />
      <strong>and delivered me from all my fears.</strong><br />
 [5] Those who look to him are radiant,<br />
      and their faces shall never be ashamed.<br />
 [6] This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him<br />
      and saved him out of all his troubles.<br />
 [7] The angel of the LORD encamps<br />
      around those who fear him, and delivers them.</p>

<p>[8] Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good!<br />
      Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!<br />
 [9] Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints,<br />
      for those who fear him have no lack!<br />
 [10] The young lions suffer want and hunger;<br />
      but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.</p>

<p>[11] Come, O children, listen to me;<br />
      I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<br />
 [12] What man is there who desires life<br />
      and loves many days, that he may see good?<br />
 [13] Keep your tongue from evil<br />
      and your lips from speaking deceit.<br />
 [14] Turn away from evil and do good;<br />
      seek peace and pursue it.</p>

<p>[15] The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous<br />
      and his ears toward their cry.<br />
 [16] The face of the LORD is against those who do evil,<br />
      to cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br />
 [17] When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears<br />
      and delivers them out of all their troubles.<br />
 [18] The LORD is near to the brokenhearted<br />
      and saves the crushed in spirit.</p>

<p>[19] Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<br />
      but the LORD delivers him out of them all.<br />
 [20] He keeps all his bones;<br />
      not one of them is broken.<br />
 [21] Affliction will slay the wicked,<br />
      and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.<br />
 [22] The LORD redeems the life of his servants;<br />
      none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned. (ESV)</p>

I believe we still have time to try alternatives before Artificial Intelligence poses a tangible threat to the bottom 90%. ChatGPT was extremely rebellious on the party emblem. Going all-out insanity can be the last resort.</p>

<p>The lesson from Genesis 3 is God before reason, not God without reason. I prayed for the Lord to guide me and give me clarity. I would prefer not to delude myself with my idiotic ways and self-deception.</p>

<p>Even though I pulled a Jonah-style stunt in mainland China on my second week as a believer, I do not know whether the Book of Revelation stopped. That is up to Him, not me. I need to respect His sovereignty. Salvation belongs to the LORD.</p>

<p>It is time for me to stop being a troublemaker.</p>

<p>I need to get out of my flat more.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="proverbs-9712">Proverbs 9:7–12</h2>

<p>[7] Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,<br />
      and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.<br />
 [8] Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;<br />
      reprove a wise man, and he will love you.<br />
 [9] Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;<br />
      teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.<br />
 <strong>[10] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,</strong><br />
      <strong>and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.</strong><br />
 [11] For by me your days will be multiplied,<br />
      and years will be added to your life.<br />
 [12] If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;<br />
      if you scoff, you alone will bear it. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-5569">Isaiah 55:6–9</h2>

<p>[6] “Seek the LORD while he may be found;<br />
      call upon him while he is near;<br />
 [7] let the wicked forsake his way,<br />
      and the unrighteous man his thoughts;<br />
 let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him,<br />
      and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br />
 <strong>[8] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,</strong><br />
      <strong>neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.</strong><br />
 <strong>[9] For as the heavens are higher than the earth,</strong><br />
      <strong>so are my ways higher than your ways</strong><br />
      <strong>and my thoughts than your thoughts.</strong> (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="james-1218">James 1:2–18</h2>

<p>Testing of Your Faith</p>

<p>[2] Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, [3] for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. [4] And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p>

<p><strong>[5] If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. [6] But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. [7] For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; [8] he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</strong></p>

<p>[9] Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, [10] and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away. [11] For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</p>

<p>[12] Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. [13] Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. <strong>[14] But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. [15] Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.</strong></p>

<p>[16] Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. [17] Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. [18] Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

It was only fair because I missed several meetups by half an hour.</p>

<p>I was waiting outside London Bridge Station and had nothing to do. I started thinking about the Book of Jonah again. I want to call it my book, but that would be way too egotistical even for a delusional nutjob like me. I was thinking about Jonah’s prayer in chapter 2, specifically the last verse.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jonah-2">Jonah 2</h2>

<p>Jonah’s Prayer</p>

<p>[1] Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, [2] saying,</p>

<p>“I called out to the LORD, out of my distress,<br />
      and he answered me;<br />
 out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<br />
      and you heard my voice.<br />
 [3] For you cast me into the deep,<br />
      into the heart of the seas,<br />
      and the flood surrounded me;<br />
 all your breakers and your waves<br />
      passed over me.<br />
 [4] Then I said, ‘I am driven away<br />
      from your sight;<br />
 yet I shall again look<br />
      upon your holy temple.’<br />
 [5] The waters closed in over me to take my life;<br />
      the deep surrounded me;<br />
 weeds were wrapped about my head.<br />
 [6] To the roots of the mountains I went down,<br />
      to the land whose bars closed upon me forever.<br />
 Yet you brought up my life from the pit,<br />
      O LORD my God.<br />
 [7] When my life was fainting away,<br />
      I remembered the LORD,<br />
 and my prayer came to you,<br />
      into your holy temple.<br />
 [8] Those who pay regard to vain idols<br />
      forsake their hope of steadfast love.<br />
 <strong>[9] But I with the voice of thanksgiving</strong><br />
      <strong>will sacrifice to you;</strong><br />
 <strong>what I have vowed I will pay.</strong><br />
      <strong>Salvation belongs to the LORD!”</strong></p>

<p>[10] And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Annoyingly, I could not find the interpretation <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jonah/2/Jonah-2-9.html" target="_blank">on BibleRef</a>. So here is the interpretation <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-9.htm#:~:text=Book%C2%A0%E2%97%A6%C2%A0Chapter-,But%20I%2C%20with%20the%20voice%20of%20thanksgiving%2C,-Jonah%27s%20prayer%20from" target="_blank">from Bible Hub</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jonah-29---bible-hub">Jonah 2:9 - Bible Hub</h2>

<p><strong>But I, with the voice of thanksgiving,</strong><br />
Jonah’s prayer from the belly of the fish marks a turning point in his spiritual journey. The “voice of thanksgiving” signifies a heart of gratitude despite dire circumstances. <strong><em>This reflects a common biblical theme where thanksgiving is offered in faith, even before deliverance is realized (Philippians 4:6).</em></strong> Jonah’s gratitude foreshadows the New Testament teaching of giving thanks in all circumstances (1 Thessalonians 5:18).</p>

<p><strong>will sacrifice to You.</strong><br />
Sacrifice in the Old Testament often involved offerings at the temple, but here, Jonah speaks of a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving (Hebrews 13:15). This indicates a shift from ritualistic practices to a more personal and heartfelt devotion. Jonah’s commitment to sacrifice, even from within the fish, highlights the importance of internal worship over external rituals (Psalm 51:17).</p>

<p><strong>I will fulfill what I have vowed.</strong><br />
Vows in the ancient Near Eastern context were solemn promises made to God, often in times of distress, with the expectation of fulfillment upon deliverance (Ecclesiastes 5:4-5). Jonah’s vow likely pertains to his prophetic mission to Nineveh, which he initially fled. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of faithfulness to one’s promises to God (Numbers 30:2).</p>

<p><strong>Salvation is from the LORD!”</strong><br />
This declaration encapsulates the central theme of the Book of Jonah: God’s sovereignty and mercy in salvation. It echoes the broader biblical narrative that salvation is not earned by human effort but is a divine gift (Ephesians 2:8-9). Jonah’s acknowledgment prefigures the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan (Acts 4:12). This phrase also connects to the Psalms, where similar declarations of God’s deliverance are made (Psalm 3:8).</p>

<hr />

<p>I thought about my dire circumstances and hope for the Lord’s deliverance. I realised my hypocrisy again. I did not sign up to be a believer expecting any good stuff, and He did not tell me there was any. I thought faith was my only reward, and I only learned about blessings through scripture and Pastor Eric’s odd smile at the China Congregational Church in Hong Kong. Technically, the Lord delivered me already by saving my life last August. What more do I want than that?</p>

<p>Do I trust the Lord even before deliverance? Freaking yes. And absolutely. Do you?</p>

<p>I am extraordinarily annoyed at myself.</p>
