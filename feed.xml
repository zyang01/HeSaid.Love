During our consultation session yesterday, he used the analogy of eating with two knives, suggesting that a political party is for winning elections, which is inherently divisive and a wrong instrument for my goals. My faithful theologian friend also reminded me that Boss Man specialised in carpentry before starting His ministry at around age 30 and going on a 2,000-year paid leave after a workplace injury.</p>

<p>Frankly, I have zero interest in getting into public office, and there are more than enough pretentious Oxford grads in the UK Parliament quarrelling over futile efforts and vanity. I also cannot imagine myself as a politician. How could I exercise abominably with talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt whilst listening to sick Berlin techno ever again? A faithful gay friend who was perhaps a little bit too zealous for planting seeds also mentioned that his friends and colleagues do not like discussing politics.</p>

<p>I did more half-assed research with ChatGPT earlier today. I realised it was a genius idea from my faithful theologian friend. Who would attack a charity campaigning on love, faith and hope even if the campaigner is a delusional nutjob? Even the projects <a href="https://biblesays.love/" target="_blank">Bible Says Love</a> and <a href="../../cuntslied/" target="_blank">Straight Cunts Lied</a> fall somewhat perfectly under a charitable umbrella. I know we need some rebranding before the next Spotify Ads campaign. I am also sure my faithful gay friend would have an easier time discussing a charitable cause after planting some seeds abominably.</p>

<p>I am taking the Faith Party treasurer to church tomorrow. The poor dude is getting fired for a job he held for less than 48 hours. But I have another elevator pitch to comfort him.</p>

<p>I also have sufficient motivation to resume my version of carpentry to fund the Faith Party Foundation.</p>

<p>Do you know how annoying it is to have a brain like mine?</p>

<p>Let’s party like it’s 1517 again.</p>

<h2 id="psalm-34">Psalm 34</h2>

<p>Taste and See That the LORD Is Good</p>

<p>Of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, so that he drove him out, and he went away.</p>

<p>[1] I will bless the LORD at all times;<br />
      his praise shall continually be in my mouth.<br />
 [2] My soul makes its boast in the LORD;<br />
      let the humble hear and be glad.<br />
 [3] Oh, magnify the LORD with me,<br />
      and let us exalt his name together!</p>

<p><strong>[4] I sought the LORD, and he answered me</strong><br />
      <strong>and delivered me from all my fears.</strong><br />
 [5] Those who look to him are radiant,<br />
      and their faces shall never be ashamed.<br />
 [6] This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him<br />
      and saved him out of all his troubles.<br />
 [7] The angel of the LORD encamps<br />
      around those who fear him, and delivers them.</p>

<p>[8] Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good!<br />
      Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!<br />
 [9] Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints,<br />
      for those who fear him have no lack!<br />
 [10] The young lions suffer want and hunger;<br />
      but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.</p>

<p>[11] Come, O children, listen to me;<br />
      I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<br />
 [12] What man is there who desires life<br />
      and loves many days, that he may see good?<br />
 [13] Keep your tongue from evil<br />
      and your lips from speaking deceit.<br />
 [14] Turn away from evil and do good;<br />
      seek peace and pursue it.</p>

<p>[15] The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous<br />
      and his ears toward their cry.<br />
 [16] The face of the LORD is against those who do evil,<br />
      to cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br />
 [17] When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears<br />
      and delivers them out of all their troubles.<br />
 [18] The LORD is near to the brokenhearted<br />
      and saves the crushed in spirit.</p>

<p>[19] Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<br />
      but the LORD delivers him out of them all.<br />
 [20] He keeps all his bones;<br />
      not one of them is broken.<br />
 [21] Affliction will slay the wicked,<br />
      and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.<br />
 [22] The LORD redeems the life of his servants;<br />
      none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned. (ESV)</p>

<p>The lesson from Genesis 3 is God before reason, not God without reason. I prayed for the Lord to guide me and give me clarity. I would prefer not to delude myself with my idiotic ways and self-deception.</p>

<p>Even though I pulled a Jonah-style stunt in mainland China on my second week as a believer, I do not know whether the Book of Revelation stopped. That is up to Him, not me. I need to respect His sovereignty. Salvation belongs to the LORD.</p>

<p>It is time for me to stop being a troublemaker.</p>

<p>I need to get out of my flat more.</p>

<h2 id="proverbs-9712">Proverbs 9:7–12</h2>

      and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.<br />
 [8] Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;<br />

<p>Testing of Your Faith</p>

<p>[2] Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, [3] for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. [4] And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p>

<p><strong>[5] If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. [6] But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. [7] For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; [8] he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</strong></p>

<p>[9] Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, [10] and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away. [11] For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</p>

<p>[12] Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. [13] Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. <strong>[14] But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. [15] Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.</strong></p>

<p>[16] Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. [17] Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. [18] Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

It was only fair because I missed several meetups by half an hour.</p>

<p>I was waiting outside London Bridge Station and had nothing to do. I started thinking about the Book of Jonah again. I want to call it my book, but that would be way too egotistical even for a delusional nutjob like me. I was thinking about Jonah’s prayer in chapter 2, specifically the last verse.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jonah-2">Jonah 2</h2>

<p>Jonah’s Prayer</p>

<p>[1] Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, [2] saying,</p>

<p>“I called out to the LORD, out of my distress,<br />
      and he answered me;<br />
 out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<br />
      and you heard my voice.<br />
 [3] For you cast me into the deep,<br />
      into the heart of the seas,<br />
      and the flood surrounded me;<br />
 all your breakers and your waves<br />
      passed over me.<br />
 [4] Then I said, ‘I am driven away<br />
      from your sight;<br />
 yet I shall again look<br />
      upon your holy temple.’<br />
 [5] The waters closed in over me to take my life;<br />
      the deep surrounded me;<br />
 weeds were wrapped about my head.<br />
 [6] To the roots of the mountains I went down,<br />
      to the land whose bars closed upon me forever.<br />
 Yet you brought up my life from the pit,<br />
      O LORD my God.<br />
 [7] When my life was fainting away,<br />
      I remembered the LORD,<br />
 and my prayer came to you,<br />
      into your holy temple.<br />
 [8] Those who pay regard to vain idols<br />
      forsake their hope of steadfast love.<br />
 <strong>[9] But I with the voice of thanksgiving</strong><br />
      <strong>will sacrifice to you;</strong><br />
 <strong>what I have vowed I will pay.</strong><br />
      <strong>Salvation belongs to the LORD!”</strong></p>

<p>[10] And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Annoyingly, I could not find the interpretation <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jonah/2/Jonah-2-9.html" target="_blank">on BibleRef</a>. So here is the interpretation <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-9.htm#:~:text=Book%C2%A0%E2%97%A6%C2%A0Chapter-,But%20I%2C%20with%20the%20voice%20of%20thanksgiving%2C,-Jonah%27s%20prayer%20from" target="_blank">from Bible Hub</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jonah-29---bible-hub">Jonah 2:9 - Bible Hub</h2>

<p><strong>But I, with the voice of thanksgiving,</strong><br />
Jonah’s prayer from the belly of the fish marks a turning point in his spiritual journey. The “voice of thanksgiving” signifies a heart of gratitude despite dire circumstances. <strong><em>This reflects a common biblical theme where thanksgiving is offered in faith, even before deliverance is realized (Philippians 4:6).</em></strong> Jonah’s gratitude foreshadows the New Testament teaching of giving thanks in all circumstances (1 Thessalonians 5:18).</p>

<p><strong>will sacrifice to You.</strong><br />
Sacrifice in the Old Testament often involved offerings at the temple, but here, Jonah speaks of a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving (Hebrews 13:15). This indicates a shift from ritualistic practices to a more personal and heartfelt devotion. Jonah’s commitment to sacrifice, even from within the fish, highlights the importance of internal worship over external rituals (Psalm 51:17).</p>

<p><strong>I will fulfill what I have vowed.</strong><br />
Vows in the ancient Near Eastern context were solemn promises made to God, often in times of distress, with the expectation of fulfillment upon deliverance (Ecclesiastes 5:4-5). Jonah’s vow likely pertains to his prophetic mission to Nineveh, which he initially fled. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of faithfulness to one’s promises to God (Numbers 30:2).</p>

<p><strong>Salvation is from the LORD!”</strong><br />
This declaration encapsulates the central theme of the Book of Jonah: God’s sovereignty and mercy in salvation. It echoes the broader biblical narrative that salvation is not earned by human effort but is a divine gift (Ephesians 2:8-9). Jonah’s acknowledgment prefigures the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan (Acts 4:12). This phrase also connects to the Psalms, where similar declarations of God’s deliverance are made (Psalm 3:8).</p>

<hr />

<p>I thought about my dire circumstances and hope for the Lord’s deliverance. I realised my hypocrisy again. I did not sign up to be a believer expecting any good stuff, and He did not tell me there was any. I thought faith was my only reward, and I only learned about blessings through scripture and Pastor Eric’s odd smile at the China Congregational Church in Hong Kong. Technically, the Lord delivered me already by saving my life last August. What more do I want than that?</p>

<p>Do I trust the Lord even before deliverance? Freaking yes. And absolutely. Do you?</p>

<p>I am extraordinarily annoyed at myself.</p>

  <p>22 March 2025 Update: See the post <a href="../on-carpentry/" target="_blank">On Carpentry</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As alluded to, I am getting involved in British politics as yet another pretentious Oxford grad and massive hypocrite.</p>

<p>A faithful theologian friend suggested yesterday that I could join one of the 300+ political parties in the United Kingdom. I could get some experience in politics and learn the ropes that way.</p>

<p>I did another cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p>If I fail, I’m not doing His will. I lose the £150 non-refundable registration fee plus some change. I become a laughing stock if I’m not one already, and Boss Man takes up residence in a handful of minds for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>If I succeed in walking into British politics completely blind, leaning not on my own understanding, and trusting Him to guide me completely, I cannot think of a better way to demonstrate the power of God than that.</p>

<p>It sounds like a good deal to me. 🤔</p>

<p>Let’s turn up the love.</p>

<p>Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake</p>

<p>[8] Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. [9] Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. [10] For</p>

<p>“Whoever desires to love life<br />
      and see good days,<br />
 let him keep his tongue from evil<br />
      and his lips from speaking deceit;<br />
 [11] let him turn away from evil and do good;<br />
      let him seek peace and pursue it.<br />
 [12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,<br />
      and his ears are open to their prayer.<br />
 But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</p>

<p><strong>[13] Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? [14] But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, [15] but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, [16] having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. [17] For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.</strong></p>

<p>[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, [19] in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, [20] because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. [21] Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, [22] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

<p>Last October, I pulled a Jonah-style stunt in mainland China to stop the Book of Revelation. Before my flight to Hong Kong, I had the longest night in the first 27 years of my life. I submitted my application to naturalise as a British citizen the month prior. I was waiting for a decision from the Home Office. It was supposed to be the fruit of 11 years of work since I arrived in the United Kingdom at age 16. I fought my entire world, including my parents, to get to where I was. I had studied for four undergraduate degrees in the last decade, had a computer science degree from the University of Oxford, cared for my two younger siblings by providing financial support to their studies in London, and worked 3 to 4 full-time remote software engineering jobs simultaneously with a mid-six figure pretax income. I walked away from over a decade’s effort by boarding that flight back to Hong Kong. I essentially walked away from my entire life. I did that for a simple reason—unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy was inevitable due to my former business partner’s unfaithfulness. I tried every single friend I had. None came except Him. Bankruptcy would have a significant impact on my citizenship application. My former business partner and friends were effectively burning down my life’s work by refusing to help, even though I had served them faithfully for years in our relationships. I did not look back even once when boarding that flight.</p>

<p>A faithful witness was the main sponsor of my global tour. She has been there since day 1 of this faith journey. We went to Chinese primary school and junior high school together. We had known each other for nearly two decades. And we exchanged messages once or twice a year before this journey. I considered her an acquaintance rather than a friend. She made a five-figure transfer the moment I asked for her help. She said she had always known she would help me with something someday. She is also the friend who dreamed about me in a war that matched details in the Book of Revelation. I had to Bible bash her into getting her first Bible.</p>

<p>You might not believe it, but I was not into playing with fire, poking the bear, walking on thin ice, or pulling the tiger’s tail. I had a lot of weird and eccentric adventures, but I was also a stickler for health and safety. I am the kind of guy who has half a dozen backup plans and can come up with a dozen more on the spot.</p>

<p>I went to the Hong Kong Baptist Church before crossing the border into mainland China. He locked me out of my hotel room with my first KJV Bible, my Caribbean passport with visa-free access to mainland China, the OpSec phone, and just enough cash to cross the border when I went to the Hong Kong Baptist Church. I cried halfway through Pastor Xander’s prayer. I felt nothing but peace and resolve after the prayer. The hotel staff had to break into my hotel room twice to help me get back in. I took a nap before getting on my way.</p>

<p>My faithful witness met me at the border. She tried to talk me out of my mission, but I made my decision. I opened my first Bible, read the Book of Jonah word by word, and prayed outside the police station in Shenzhen before turning myself in. An hour later, I stood outside the police station feeling utterly confused. I did not have a backup plan for that. The Book of Jonah also said it was supposed to be a three-day journey. The slacking would be way too obvious. One of the three things He promised was to take me where I wanted to go. I had always wanted to visit Shanghai and Beijing. It happened to be the week of celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Beijing was the lions’ den and in extra lockdown. Shanghai next?</p>

<p>I checked into the Shangri-La Hotel in Pudong, Shanghai, took a nap, had dinner and walked to the nearest police station. The police chief was fuming to be woken up and called in at 4 AM. He offered to buy me breakfast three hours later and asked me to wait patiently a little bit longer for his colleagues at the religious management bureau to start work. I signed and fingerprinted police statements after discussing epistemology and arguing over the wording to accurately reflect my intentions and the message I brought them. I was offered a ride back to the hotel and advised to enjoy my holiday and head home. I hoped to take the train from the Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station to Shenzhen. I could not get a train ticket as the week-long national holiday was about to end. The Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport was next door. Go big or go home. Beijing next.</p>

<p>I checked into the Four Seasons Hotel in Chaoyang District, Beijing and repeated the same routine. I met the friendliest police officer ever. I was in and out of the police station in Beijing within 10 minutes. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Say what you will about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They brought over a billion people out of poverty. I did not need to watch my back when wandering the city streets at 3 AM. Chinese constitution had an interesting amendment in 2018. The CCP has an interesting political motto—<strong>when people have faith, the nation has strength, and the country has a future</strong>.</p>

<p>Maybe we can learn a thing or two from China.</p>

<h2 id="matthew-13117">Matthew 13:1–17</h2>

<p>The Parable of the Sower</p>

<p>[1] That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. [2] And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. [3] And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. [4] And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. [5] Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, [6] but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. [7] Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. [8] Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. [9] He who has ears, let him hear.”</p>

<p>The Purpose of the Parables</p>

<p>[10] Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” [11] And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. [12] For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [13] This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. [14] Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:</p>

<p>“‘“You will indeed hear but never understand,<br />
      and you will indeed see but never perceive.”<br />
 [15] For this people’s heart has grown dull,<br />
      and with their ears they can barely hear,<br />
      and their eyes they have closed,<br />
 lest they should see with their eyes<br />
      and hear with their ears<br />
 and understand with their heart<br />
      and turn, and I would heal them.’</p>

<p>[16] But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. [17] For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. (ESV)</p>

After this 25-week and 3-day journey, I believe I finally learned what the word <em><strong>trust</strong></em> means. I believe I also know how to spell the word <em><strong>God</strong></em>.</p>

<p>If I’m worried, concerned or scared, I’m not trusting Him. I can solve all of my problems by trusting Him. I cannot logically explain that to you. It is simply something that I believe and know without a single doubt in my mind. That does not mean I can sit around and chill. I still need to do my part to the best of my abilities. And God knows I freaking love to try a ton of whacky ideas. Dude needs to pull me back most of the time and tell me to chill. But otherwise, what is the point of existing if I do nothing at all?</p>

<p>I can trust Him and endure all things, including death and the world turning on me because I know He knows better than me.</p>

<p>He is <em><strong>God</strong></em>. What do I have to worry about?</p>

<p>It feels freaking weird, but I have to admit I’m loving it, reluctantly.</p>

<p>I might just be one of the luckiest people alive.</p>

<p>Proverbs 3:1–12</p>

<p>Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart</p>

<p>[1] My son, do not forget my teaching,<br />
      but let your heart keep my commandments,<br />
 [2] for length of days and years of life<br />
      and peace they will add to you.</p>

<p>[3] Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;<br />
      bind them around your neck;<br />
      write them on the tablet of your heart.<br />
 [4] So you will find favor and good success<br />
      in the sight of God and man.</p>

<p>[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,<br />
      and do not lean on your own understanding.<br />
 [6] In all your ways acknowledge him,<br />
      and he will make straight your paths.<br />
 [7] Be not wise in your own eyes;<br />
      fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.<br />
 [8] It will be healing to your flesh<br />
      and refreshment to your bones.</p>

<p>[9] Honor the LORD with your wealth<br />
      and with the firstfruits of all your produce;<br />
 [10] then your barns will be filled with plenty,<br />
      and your vats will be bursting with wine.</p>

<p>[11] My son, do not despise the LORD’s discipline<br />
      or be weary of his reproof,<br />
 [12] for the LORD reproves him whom he loves,<br />
      as a father the son in whom he delights. (ESV)</p>

<p>Let me suffer because we are forgetful. I don’t want to forget His saving grace and become an ungrateful bastard.</p>

<p>Let me save some people, including rampant homosexuals, because I love them.</p>

<p>Teach me to have faith strong enough to walk on water. It sounds super fun. Jesus and Peter did it.</p>

<p>Give me strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. I needed that due to what happened.</p>

<p>Guide the people I know or meet back to Him, show them His light, and give them strength, courage and wisdom to overcome. It’s a good thing, and why not?</p>

<p>Give people I know or meet the Holy Spirit. It gets annoying when people think you are insane.</p>

<p>Let me die. Asked for that a bunch of times because people in my life have been really faithful.</p>

<p>Help me forgive because I really could not.</p>

<p>Thank Him because He was good to me in the first 27 years of my life even when I did not know Him. Not to mention He literally saved my life last year.</p>

<p>Let me rest because I have been working my ass off, and some people blew my first proper holiday.</p>

<p>Initially, I had the name Restore Faith Party in mind, but the domain name restore.faith costs over £500, and I could barely afford a cup of vanilla latte with coconut milk. By the grace of God, I managed to secure the domain name <a href="https://www.faithparty.org/" target="_blank">FaithParty.org</a> earlier this morning for $7.66 (£5.91), the price of a cup of vanilla latte with coconut milk at London RPI with spare change. As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Rust</a> developer, I’m also a gigantic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" target="_blank">functional programming</a> (FP) fanboy.</p>

<p>I am working on the <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-06/RP1%20GB%20updated%20May%202023.pdf" target="_blank">RP1 GB form</a> (Application to register a political party in Great Britain). Due to my poor history of managing personal finance, I would raise more than a few eyebrows if I signed up to be the treasurer. I asked a faithful new friend if he would like the honour. I want the Lord to be the party leader, but I do not have the postcode for His current address. I am also reluctant to ask for His telephone number and email address. Therefore, I disgracefully nominated myself for the interim position. Hopefully, this will be the last time I try over-employment. I almost threw myself off the balcony when I did that last time.</p>

<h2 id="draft-launch-manifesto">Draft Launch Manifesto</h2>

<p>We make zero effort to pretend we have the answers and solutions to all our problems. No single human being in our party makes any final decisions. Only God has the final say. We reason within the boundaries and understanding He gives us. We will make mistakes. We are all flawed and imperfect, like the first man who sinned against God. We operate on one and only one law - love.</p>

<p>The definition of love is the greatest sacrifice one is willing to make. Just ask any father what they are willing to sacrifice for their child.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="romans-13814">Romans 13:8–14</h3>

<p>Fulfilling the Law Through Love</p>

<p><strong>[8] Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. [9] For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [10] Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</strong></p>

<p>[11] Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. [12] The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. [13] Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. [14] But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Our long-term goal is to restore faith in everyone’s heart so that we don’t, by default, assume the worst of each other. We want to build a society where we, by default, presume the best of each other. We don’t know how to achieve that (yet), but we can start with a tiny step at a time.</p>

<p>The three not-so-tiny steps we currently have on <a href="../on-money-and-fiscal-policy/" target="_blank">the agenda</a> are the following.</p>

<p>Shelter God’s children by taking them off the streets, feeding and putting a roof over them.</p>

<p>Reunite communities, including but not limited to LGBTQIA+, with God and let them know they are loved too.</p>

<p>Prepare humanity to defend against <a href="https://letter.hesaid.love/" target="_blank">the socioeconomic tsunami</a> brought about by Artificial Intelligence we have never seen before. We sincerely hope we are wrong, but we face significant unemployment rates and suffering globally for the bottom 90%.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="matthew-62534">Matthew 6:25–34</h3>

<p>Do Not Be Anxious</p>

<p>[25] “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. <strong>[33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</strong></p>

<p>[34] “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (ESV)</p>

<p>True and False Fasting</p>

<p>[1] “Cry aloud; do not hold back;<br />
      lift up your voice like a trumpet;<br />
 declare to my people their transgression,<br />
      to the house of Jacob their sins.<br />
 [2] Yet they seek me daily<br />
      and delight to know my ways,<br />
 as if they were a nation that did righteousness<br />
      and did not forsake the judgment of their God;<br />
 they ask of me righteous judgments;<br />
      they delight to draw near to God.<br />
 [3] ‘Why have we fasted, and you see it not?<br />
      Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?’<br />
 Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure,<br />
      and oppress all your workers.<br />
 [4] Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight<br />
      and to hit with a wicked fist.<br />
 Fasting like yours this day<br />
      will not make your voice to be heard on high.<br />
 [5] Is such the fast that I choose,<br />
      a day for a person to humble himself?<br />
 Is it to bow down his head like a reed,<br />
      and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?<br />
 Will you call this a fast,<br />
      and a day acceptable to the LORD?</p>

<p><strong>[6] “Is not this the fast that I choose:</strong><br />
      <strong>to loose the bonds of wickedness,</strong><br />
      <strong>to undo the straps of the yoke,</strong><br />
 <strong>to let the oppressed go free,</strong><br />
      <strong>and to break every yoke?</strong><br />
 <strong>[7] Is it not to share your bread with the hungry</strong><br />
      <strong>and bring the homeless poor into your house;</strong><br />
 <strong>when you see the naked, to cover him,</strong><br />
      <strong>and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?</strong><br />
 <strong>[8] Then shall your light break forth like the dawn,</strong><br />
      <strong>and your healing shall spring up speedily;</strong><br />
 <strong>your righteousness shall go before you;</strong><br />
      <strong>the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.</strong><br />
 <strong>[9] Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;</strong><br />
      <strong>you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’</strong><br />
 <strong>If you take away the yoke from your midst,</strong><br />
      <strong>the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,</strong><br />
 <strong>[10] if you pour yourself out for the hungry</strong><br />
      <strong>and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,</strong><br />
 <strong>then shall your light rise in the darkness</strong><br />
      <strong>and your gloom be as the noonday.</strong><br />
 <strong>[11] And the LORD will guide you continually</strong><br />
      <strong>and satisfy your desire in scorched places</strong><br />
      <strong>and make your bones strong;</strong><br />
 <strong>and you shall be like a watered garden,</strong><br />
      <strong>like a spring of water,</strong><br />
      <strong>whose waters do not fail.</strong><br />
 <strong>[12] And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;</strong><br />
      <strong>you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;</strong><br />
 <strong>you shall be called the repairer of the breach,</strong><br />
      <strong>the restorer of streets to dwell in.</strong></p>

<p>[13] “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath,<br />
      from doing your pleasure on my holy day,<br />
 and call the Sabbath a delight<br />
      and the holy day of the LORD honorable;<br />
 if you honor it, not going your own ways,<br />
      or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly;<br />
 [14] then you shall take delight in the LORD,<br />
      and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth;<br />
 I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father,<br />
      for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.” (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="draft-party-emblem">Draft Party Emblem</h2>

<p>I have been working on the party emblem and have three draft designs. ChatGPT kept rebelling against my instruction to reflect the full party slogan—”Love in Action. Faith in People. Hope for the Future.”—in the design. I resorted to asking my faithful new friend again if he had any faithful artist friends who might be interested. The gig would be fully credited. The down payment is in the form of a bestseller with a full invoice paid on an unknown future date if they charge above-market premium rates.</p>

<p>After checking out the emblems of <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/political-registration-and-regulation/political-party-registration" target="_blank">existing political parties</a> and double-checking with ChatGPT, I learned that party emblems submitted to the Electoral Commission for use on ballot papers must be in black and white.

<h3 id="edit-again">Edit Again</h3>

<p>I took a nap and just woke up feeling annoyed again at ChatGPT. It kept refusing to clean up the 2020s on both sides of the emblem and arrange the slogan as I instructed. As I was lying in bed listening to Ed Sheeran’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34gCuhDGsG4bRPIf9bb02f?si=9f2626232c204b37" target="_blank"><em>Thinking out Loud</em></a>, I remembered the year 2020 was when I had my first calling. It was the first and only time I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA" target="_blank">MDMA</a> in my life, and I messaged my friend. We <a href="../on-confirmation/" target="_blank">matriculated</a> at <a href="../on-more-interesting-coincidences/" target="_blank">Keble College, Oxford</a> together. Her father is a Christian missionary in mainland China, who He told me to talk to, and He said the answers are there. As someone with a pretty severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder" target="_blank">OCD</a>, I like keeping records, and I found the messages I sent five years ago on WeChat. I had not even touched a humanity’s bestseller before then, let alone reading it. If you don’t read simplified Chinese, I used the pronoun ‘It’ rather than ‘He’. The mobile app version of Google Translate has a camera function that you can use. You tell me if He exists.</p>

<p>I had to do a reality check every morning, even in January this year. I would contemplate whether the last several months did happen, whether I had gone batshit crazy and if I should check into a mental hospital. Dude unscrewed and removed the door for me at this point. I cannot shut the door even if I want to. There is no going back. You cannot run away from God.</p>

<p>Now you know why <a href="../on-drugs/" target="_blank">I don’t do MDMA</a>.</p>

<p>And yes, I am fully aware of the implications of what I just publically admitted to. What did I say about telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and getting fucked in the ass by talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt for 4hrs+ non-stop whilst listening to sick Berlin techno?</p>

<h2 id="draft-party-constitution">Draft Party Constitution</h2>

<p>I cheated again by asking ChatGPT to write the draft party constitution. Frankly, I could not have done it better myself. It’s slightly longer than one page, but considering the legal and formal language involved, it’s still better than <a href="https://public.conservatives.com/organisation-department/202101/Conservative%20Party%20Constitution%20%20as%20amended%20January%202021.pdf" target="_blank">Conservative’s 58</a> and <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Rule-Book-2024.pdf" target="_blank">Labour’s 146</a>. You have to give credit where credit is due. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" target="_blank">full version</a> and more details can be found on humanity’s bestseller.</p>
