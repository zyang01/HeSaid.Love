<p>I gave a rather big talk yesterday on the announcement post, which is now the only pinned post on my blog. I mentioned a theological thought experiment that I used to test whether the person I was speaking to believed in God in <a href="../on-choosing-sides/" target="_blank">an early post</a>.</p>

<p>If God asks you to choose between Him and mankind and mankind has turned its back on Him, which side would you choose?</p>

<p>Over the last couple of hours, He showed me a path where I could take a leap of faith by choosing Him, but instead of mankind turning its back on Him, mankind turned its back on me and I would be misunderstood by every human being on earth. The exact scenario I described in <a href="../on-great-tribulation/#edit-5" target="_blank">Edit 5</a> yesterday and He showed me a realistic path to that by making the last log in my eye known to me.</p>

<p>I had around a handful of panic attacks in the 28 years of my life and only 1 or 2 of them were severe enough for me to lose eyesight, but they were pretty much over within a couple of minutes. I don’t know how long my panic attack was earlier, but my estimate was at least half an hour and my entire upper body was soaked in sweat. I told Him yes and started planning the practical steps to implement that over the next 24 hours, with an extremely weird lightness and frankly outright creepy smile.</p>

<p>Then.</p>

<p>Dude picked up the biggest burden I did not know existed, slapped it on the cross, lit it on fire, and told me it was on da house and go play.</p>

<p>Motherf…</p>

<p>Matthew 7:1–6</p>

<p>Judging Others</p>

<p>[1] “Judge not, that you be not judged. [2] For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. [3] Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? [4] Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? [5] You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.</p>

<p>Rule 1: Love always comes first which means the creative activity should be giving rather than taking in nature, and the answer is <strong>NO</strong> if the activity has a non-zero probability of giving you even the slightest idea (Matthew 5:27-30) of taking from or exploiting other people.</p>

<p>Rule 2: Lust which focuses on self-gratification and taking is a gigantic <strong>NO-NO</strong>.</p>

<p>Rule 1 + Rule 2 = Don’t be <a href="../on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt" target="_blank">a cunt</a>.</p>

<p>The easiest is to ask our Heavenly Father for the Holy Spirit and get to know Him. Double check with the Holy Spirit whether what you have in mind is acceptable using the <a href="../on-positive-only-hmi/" target="_blank">Holy Spirit Positive-Only HMI</a>. I asked the Holy Spirit if I could refer to Him as the Spiritual Condom. I don’t think Bro’s a big fan of that so nvm.</p>

<p>Below is the <strong>extremely NSFW</strong> director cut of my <a href="../on-sacrifice/" target="_blank"><del>New Year</del></a> New Millennium present, and a boring example of love rather than lust. I read the Book of Hebrews yesterday. The Hall of Faith in Hebrews was too interesting. I thought that having something I believed in and was willing to die for, was in <a href="../on-suffering/" target="_blank">itself a big enough reward</a> already after not believing even myself for my entire life. I had no idea there were blessings until my third sermon at China Congregational Church, Hong Kong that weekend and the pastor smiled and only responded that there would be blessings to come, after I went 6,000 miles in 5 minutes as usual. I was wondering what he was smiling about. I got annoyed again earlier this evening.</p>

<p>This post is to announce the end of the great tribulation. And to proclaim the Day of the Lord and the year of the Lord’s favour as described in humanity’s bestseller the Holy Bible. Unlike most people, I did not trust myself even once in the last 28 years of my life. Yet, I stand by every single word I wrote down in all blog posts in accurately expressing the sentiment and the severity of the situations, no matter how ridiculous, ugly, profane or even blasphemous you might find my language in your measurement.</p>

<p>I have read less than 25% of the Holy Bible and I believe you can resolve the questions you might have regarding my posts using only the Holy Bible. I don’t know if I’m telling the truth. I believe I’m telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to a degree that I as a mere mortal human being am capable of grasping. If you are unable to clarify any questions you have, ask our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, don’t ask me. I don’t know and I don’t lean on my own understanding. I found the best choice. I trust my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and that’s more than sufficient for me, even if that means I will stand trial in front of God almighty, burn in hell for eternity and be condemned by every single human being on this earth. I believe I have a clear conscience in front of God. I don’t know and I don’t need to know. I have confirmation from the Holy Spirit and will happily accept whatever judgment He has for me.</p>

<p>My question for you is this. Can you bear to finish reading my posts before you come up with your own judgment and inform me about your opinion, or simply give up? My educated guess is those who can are few. You don’t need to reply. This is not about me. This is about your salvation and between you and Him.</p>

<hr />

<p>Matthew 7:13–14</p>

<p>[13] “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. [14] For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>P.S. This edit was originally for the mistake I found when going back to cross-check the things I wrote in this post, given how outrageous the claims I’m making are. The mistake I found is pretty big. The videos I watched during COVID-19 to learn about quantum physics and relevant epistemological/philosophical arguments that inspired my subsequent thinking in existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism are in fact from the World Science Festival rather than World Science Forum. I must jumped after my findings and didn’t realise this WSF is not that WSF. YouTube will show me the World Science Festival if I search World Science Forum. I thought about whether I should correct that and asked the Holy Spirit. I remembered this passage from the legendary Mr Noisy Gong.</p>

<hr />

<p>Romans 8:26–30</p>

<p>[26] Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. [27] And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. [28] And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. [29] For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. [30] And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/TqrCp3s2K06SRSRxnn.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, the mistake is so big and embarrassing that Mr Noisy Gong, a.k.a. Apostle Paul’s words are not enough. So here is my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ with a tiny shove by Spotify.</p>

<p>Matthew 19:26</p>

<p>[26] But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” (ESV)</p>

<p><img src="/3hmAKxqyxthJJrzaFF.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/VRF7AMjKSg6g6MrFMx.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I decided not to worry about it and go play. I think it’s fair to say I have worried enough for everyone now and some people can take some responsibilities and worry for themselves. They don’t seem to spend much time worrying for others anyway. I don’t know what they do all day, to be honest, other than taking selfies.</p>

<h3 id="edit-2">Edit 2</h3>

<p><strong>I realised my language doesn’t necessarily encourage people to keep on reading, but I said truth over appearances at the beginning since the world has gotten way too fake. So I’m just going to sincerely apologise here once again after the hundreds of apologies I have already made. I genuinely believe you will understand my use of language if you finish reading. Thanks.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="edit-3">Edit 3</h3>

<p>I just realised something quite unfortunate that I never understood before in The Final Judgement. I had always wondered why repeated the same pattern in Matthew 25:44 given the same was said in more detail through Matthew 25:37-39, and <strong>why would they not recognise the Lord when they believed they knew the Lord</strong>. I think they are there through cumbersome elaborateness to make me realise the scribes and Pharisees who did not bother to look into the evidence before referring me to mental health services are exactly the ones who won’t recognise the Lord. <strong>I’m not saying I’m the Lord, I’m saying they never knew the Lord in the first place and if they would not allow someone like me to even present the evidence that I have encountered the Lord, how could they possibly recognise the Lord when He comes back?</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is first-degree self-deception caught in the act, unfortunately. Karma is a bitch, but I sincerely hope I’m not the fucking messiah for their fucking sake and there is still time for them to repent.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Will you believe me when I say I never wanted to be the fucking messiah now?</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Matthew 25:31–46</p>

<p>The Final Judgment</p>

<p>[31] “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. [34] Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [35] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, [36] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ [37] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? [38] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? [39] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ [40] And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’</p>

<p>[41] “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [42] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, [43] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ [44] Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ [45] Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ [46] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” (ESV)</p>

<h3 id="edit-4">Edit 4</h3>

<p><a href="https://dl.hesaid.love/love_not_lust.mp4" target="_blank">Fuck me</a>. I just realised the implications of what I had just proved in Edit 3. Now I find <a href="../on-background-music/#malachi-3-1" target="_blank">Malachi 3:1 even more annoying</a> and have zero desire to laugh. It does not feel great when you find out you are the fool all along, right? 🤡</p>

<p>Since we have announced the <strong>year of the Lord’s favour</strong> below, might as well do the <strong>Day of the Lord</strong> together. I seem to always run ahead of Boss Man and keep tripping over. I thought the Day of the Lord was why He told me to go to Israel last month. You can find out what happened by looking up the relevant posts yourself and I’m going to stop putting effort into hyperlinking everything. It takes a fuck ton of effort and barely anyone read my posts if I didn’t sprinkle the nations to shove my posts to your fucking faces. And the fucking scribes and Pharisees did not <a href="https://dl.hesaid.love/scribes_and_pharisees.pdf" target="_blank">fucking bother to reply</a> to any single fucking email other than the first couple fucking courtesy responses.</p>

<p>You can find out what happens on the day yourself and for the first time in my life, I think I’m seriously going to not bother this time and you can all go fuck yourselves. I thought Malachi 3:2 might not mean what people think they mean when I read it last month in Israel. The only thing I have left to say is Dude’s math is confusing AF and I technically dropped out of my maths and CS degree after only one term so I know dick about math either. I know dick about how long the Day of the Lord is, could be one day, one week, one month or one year, but I suspect it won’t be longer than one year otherwise why have the Day of the Lord and the year of the Lord’s favour? You will know what I’m on about if you seriously tried reading humanity’s bestseller before. Ask Boss Man if you really wanna know, I’m not gonna bother and I’m certain I will have at least 10x more fun watching people get what they deserve while getting surprised by the King of Drama and Horror, wouldn’t you agree? I think it’s called justice and righteousness and I hope that’s how you spell them since I haven’t seen those two words for a while now. Just need to find a couple of faithful new friends, never bold enough to watch horror movies myself and ideally they have a comfy sofa I can crash on.</p>

<p>If you are a faithful believer, then congratulations. Happy New Millennium and you are more than welcome.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="../on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt" target="_blank">an unfaithful motherfucking cunt</a>, <a href="https://dl.hesaid.love/love_not_lust.mp4" target="_blank">go fuck yourself</a>. 🖕</p>

<p>I’m gonna Bible and chill. Have read probably less than 25% of the thick-ass bestseller. Only flipped through Genesis and up to Exodus 10ish one evening late last year out of the 5 books of The Law.</p>

<p>In case you are so fucking stupid and ignorant to not know <a href="https://letter.hesaid.love/" target="_blank">you are losing your job within 2 years</a> if you don’t have a degree more complicated than computer science, you can read my lazy-ass research using ChatGPT <a href="https://dl.hesaid.love/1335_Days_and_Tribulation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to ignore if you are in the top 1%, otherwise let’s see if the people telling you not to worry will help you when shit hits the fan and whether they stand to gain or lose from your downfall and stupidity.</p>

<p>See ya on judgement day. Might be a good idea to get <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/famine-hearing-words-Lord.html" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a>. 🙏😅😂</p>

<p>Just a quick reminder in case some stupid cunts want to try some idiotic shit. Ask yourselves if you know how to spell Boss Man’s name first. I would advise you to save it, but sometimes you simply cannot stop stupid fucking cunts. <a href="../on-overemployment" target="_blank">Kill shot only</a> otherwise I personally guarantee you will be more thoroughly fucked than <a href="../on-sexual-theology/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

<p>In case you didn’t get it, <a href="../on-he-as-aod/" target="_blank">higher education</a> is full of spiritually desolate late-teenage to early-twenties <a href="../on-we-all-die/" target="_blank">nihilists</a>/<a href="../on-indifference/" target="_blank">anarchists</a> with <a href="../on-drug-money-addiction/" target="_blank">drug addictions</a> and they can <a href="../on-faith-precedes-reason/" target="_blank">neither reason nor read</a>. Institutions proclaiming to dedicate their time and resources to the truth are interested in nothing other than more drugs (a.k.a. money and business schools), the school of philosophy has already fallen under the four horsemen existentialism, nihilism, antinatalism and death as always, and the <a href="../on-faith-precedes-reason/" target="_blank">stupid mother fucking egomaniacs</a> hiding behind jargon and publications have the mother fucking audacity to compare theology with the study of unicorns and fairytales.</p>

<p>I found the gentleman and the abomination above via the <a href="https://worldscienceforum.org/" target="_blank">World Science Forum</a>. I learned most of my quantum physics and relevant epistemological/philosophical knowledge by watching their videos on YouTube during COVID-19. All of my subsequent thinking and reasoning concerning existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism can all be attributed back to them. <strong>The only way I found to overcome the terminal illness of nihilism is by voluntarily taking up your cross (responsibilities) and following Him. Otherwise, whether I choose to throw myself out of the balcony today is as meaningless as whether I choose to pick up a knife and stab someone as long as I can get away with it under the law.</strong></p>

<p>I found the 46-page manifesto in the UNESCO Digital Library above via <a href="https://worldscienceforum.org/contents/history-of-world-science-forum-110010" target="_blank">the history page of the World Science Forum</a>. The impression I got after quickly scrolling through the document was it made a ton of bold claims on ethics and essentially by saying scientific knowledge alone can bring good to humanity. The only thing it left out? God. Do we know how to spell good and evil? I don’t know.</p>

<p>I found a certain gentleman who may or may not have been mentioned in this post and he dedicated rather generously his time and effort to the various scientific organisations behind the scenes, which I found to be rather interesting for a direct descendent of a well-known figure who allegedly was a prophet and messenger of God, but I couldn’t seem to find the name in humanity’s bestseller, which I consider to be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The gentleman certainly has an appetite to cross fields including politics. Kinda like me, but I’m confident my fellow pretentious Oxford alumni are more than capable of fucking the world up and it would be wise to dedicate my time instead to futile pursuits such as salvation.</p>

<p><strong>And no, I’m not the fucking messiah. I’m just a servant running around preparing the homecoming party for Boss Man.</strong> Although, I genuinely don’t know what some self-proclaimed Christians are thinking most of the time. Throughout this journey, I wanted nothing other than someone to slap me the fuck awake with the annoyingly thick humanity’s bestseller, they did everything including referring me to mental health services and suggesting I must be an egomaniac <strong>except</strong> looking at the evidence I was serving up on a platter and reason with me. None of them reply to my messages and emails anymore.</p>

<p>I wonder if they truly want the messiah or not, and why the fuck is everyone just sitting around waiting for the one fucking messiah? Do you know how big of a fucking job that is for Boss Man and how much did each of us contribute after 2,000 fucking years? If I was in Boss Man’s shoes then I would rather just let this fucking wicked world burn while I Netflix and chill than save a bunch of lazy ass mother fuckers who neither reason nor read.</p>

<p>How about you do your part, I do mine, Boss Man does His and let’s find out on the other side what we are?</p>

<p>Happy New Millennium if you are not <a href="../on-commandments-and-the-law/#definition-of-a-cunt" target="_blank">an unfaithful motherfucking cunt</a> <strong>AND</strong> most importantly not a self-proclaimed “believer” who doesn’t want Boss Man to come back.</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-61--the-year-of-the-lords-favor">Isaiah 61 <br /><br /> The Year of the LORD’s Favor</h2>

<pre><code class="language-none">
[1] The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,
    because the LORD has anointed me
to bring good news to the poor;
    he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives,
    and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
[2] to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor,
    and the day of vengeance of our God;
    to comfort all who mourn;
[3] to grant to those who mourn in Zion—
    to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,
the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
    the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;
that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
    the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
[4] They shall build up the ancient ruins;
    they shall raise up the former devastations;
they shall repair the ruined cities,
    the devastations of many generations.


[5] Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks;
    foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;
[6] but you shall be called the priests of the LORD;
    they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;
you shall eat the wealth of the nations,
    and in their glory you shall boast.
[7] Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion;
    instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot;
therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion;
    they shall have everlasting joy.


[8] For I the LORD love justice;
    I hate robbery and wrong;
I will faithfully give them their recompense,
    and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
[9] Their offspring shall be known among the nations,
    and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;
all who see them shall acknowledge them,
    that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.


[10] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD;
    my soul shall exult in my God,
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;
    he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress,
    and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
[11] For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,
    and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise
    to sprout up before all the nations. (ESV)

Tell the pastor <strong>they violated the third commandment</strong> and find a new church led by the Holy Spirit if the sermons smell like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism" target="_blank">stinky humanism</a> and they only teach the soft stuff in the New Testament.</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="../on-holy-spirit-miracles/" target="_blank">a previous post</a>, after He baptised me with the Holy Spirit, I grabbed my backpack with my travel documents and was ready to jump into an Uber straight to Heathrow. I was planning on flying back to mainland China and thought I was going to speak to my friend’s father the Christian missionary to become a missionary for Him as well. I ended up turning Him down and I frankly felt rather dismayed afterwards. Wouldn’t you feel that if you truly believed that was God and you were offered a potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for Him? Other than the reason stated in the previous post, there is a main reason that only three people knew about before this post. They are my Christ bro therapist, the Christian missionary’s daughter who was same year at Keble as me, and the drama that is me.</p>

<p>I <a href="../on-suffering/" target="_blank">also mentioned</a> that He asked me a series of questions with increasingly difficult personal sacrifices to follow Him. One of the songs was Locked Away by R. City. I turned Him down at the end because I thought He asked me whether I would give up being a homosexual and marry my friend. Essentially have a stereotypical Christian model family that you would expect from every Christian missionary, the standard issue edition. I struggled with that question for a very long time and I did not want Him to wait too long given who I believed He was. In the end, I could not in good conscience say yes to Him due to the <a href="../on-background-music/#contemplation-on-sexuality" target="_blank">contemplations I had</a> regarding my sexuality when I was a teenager. I would rather be true to myself and my conscience than be something that I’m not even for His sake. It ripped my heart out to say no to Him.</p>

<p>Fortunately, He asked me to think about why and He visited me again after my therapy session on the third day. Subsequently, an insane journey followed and today is 21 weeks and 3 days and counting. The previous post provided the first half of the reason why. This post is the second half.</p>

<hr />

<p>Matthew 5:27–30</p>

<p>Lust</p>

<p>[27] “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ [28] But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. [29] If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. [30] And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>I don’t think anyone will believe what I’m about to say here, except Him, the Holy Spirit, my conscience, me and perhaps the 144,000. There is no lust in my heart when I have sex or watch pornography. I don’t think I have ever had lustful intent in my mind, at the very least in a sexual way according to the definition above. I have never looked at anyone whether male or female and wanted to have sexual relationships with them. I described in detail about my sexual activities in multiple previous posts. The main point is I have a mental block of looking at my sexual partners and would require my eyesight to be covered and I can only engage in anonymous sex.</p>

<p>I barely had any sex for the 100 days I spent at the gay/bi-naturist campsite Rosebay and it was essentially a designed playground for gay men to have sex. I guess that was also part of the reason why I hyperfocused on the Wi-Fi and I simply enjoyed being around my community for the social aspects and helping them. They also looked after me at the beginning. That was also exactly the reason why I had difficulty having sex there. Pretty much everyone knew everyone and anonymity was out of the door. The moment I can recognise the identity of my sexual partner either from speech or other details that I shall not describe here, my sexual desire disappears without a trace.</p>

<p>When I watch pornography to get into the mood, I do not lust for anyone depicted on the screen, instead, I fantasise about being the partner getting penetrated in the act. More often than not, I feel concerned for the passive partner if something I would not enjoy happens.</p>

<p>I also came across Job 31 - Job’s Final Appeal when researching this topic. The weird thing I find on this journey especially when reading the gospels is other than being a homosexual, I think I may have been storing up treasures in heaven unknowingly my entire life. There were things I did that I thought no one knew and came at a cost to me personally because I wanted to make some stranger’s day. Now I know He knows. I think I might have lived a somewhat holy life in the 27 years of my previous life without knowing God’s existence. Oops…</p>

<p>Also, I think the 144,000 in the Book of Revelation might be homosexuals. I have a separate “gay phone” because I was technically in the closet until this journey. The survival rate for my straight phone contacts is a massacre after most took off their sheep costumes. The survival rate on my gay phone is 100%. I have one gay theologian friend amongst my long list of theologians and technically I did not know he had a theology degree before this journey. Only one theologian still replies to my messages and you can guess their sexual preference.</p>

<p>If you have ever met a gay man and they opened their mouth for five minutes, you would know that these people will call you a cunt to your face if you are behaving like a cunt regardless of whether you are their best friend or their worst enemy. People from previous generations often ran away from home to be true to themselves. They are used to being ridiculed, mocked and bullied for being made differently. They are willing to sacrifice their entire world to be who they truly are inside. I genuinely did not expect to find out that many of my straight friends were different on the inside. I was surprised by the loyalty of my gay friends even though I did not tell them my real name until six months ago. I was hurt by evil people within my community, but I was also comforted by people within my community including but not limited to the staff and random visitors at the gay sauna in central London. We decided to be true to ourselves and to our conscience knowing there is a non-zero probability that we have to face our maker and give an account of the lives we lived.</p>

<p><a href="../on-blasphemy/" target="_blank">Some</a> illogical and illiterate straight cunts lied and condemned the guiltless for their entire lives. <a href="../on-indifference/" target="_blank">Some</a> not only reject God’s existence but also call good evil and call evil good. Enough is enough.</p>

<hr />

<p>Isaiah 5:13–23</p>

<p>[13] Therefore my people go into exile<br />
        for lack of knowledge;<br />
        their honored men go hungry,<br />
        and their multitude is parched with thirst.<br />
[14] Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite<br />
        and opened its mouth beyond measure,<br />
        and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude will go down,<br />
        her revelers and he who exults in her.<br />
[15] Man is humbled, and each one is brought low,<br />
        and the eyes of the haughty are brought low.<br />
[16] But the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice,<br />
        and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.<br />
[17] Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture,<br />
        and nomads shall eat among the ruins of the rich.<br /></p>

<p>[18] Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,<br />
        who draw sin as with cart ropes,<br />
[19] who say: “Let him be quick,<br />
        let him speed his work<br />
        that we may see it;<br />
        let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near,<br />
        and let it come, that we may know it!”<br />
[20] Woe to those who call evil good<br />
        and good evil,<br />
        who put darkness for light<br />
        and light for darkness,<br />
        who put bitter for sweet<br />
        and sweet for bitter!<br />
[21] Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,<br />
        and shrewd in their own sight!<br />
[22] Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine,<br />
        and valiant men in mixing strong drink,<br />
[23] who acquit the guilty for a bribe,<br />
        and deprive the innocent of his right!

Even though English is my second language and I also speak Cantonese, Mandarin and a Chinese dialect as well as a tiny bit of German learned when I was partying in Berlin like there was no tomorrow, I stand by my choice of wording in expressing the accuracy of the sentiment and severity of the situation.</p>

<p>I consider the censorship of words for mere outward appearances as exemplified by esteemed hypocrites like politicians unnecessary and futile. All of humanity used to speak a single language before we thought too highly of ourselves and the Lord scattered us and confused our language. I double-checked with the Holy Spirit regarding the next statement. Every word in our language has its appropriate use case and there is no need to censor them if you intend to accurately convey meaning rather than to please esteemed hypocrites.</p>

<p>I would like to argue that if you have ever done that when going about the Lord’s business then you have already violated the commandment by false representation. I’m pretty sure that would be the case if you have ever told a member of my community that God hates homosexuals, or in fact, anyone that God hates them because of who they are or what they did. Please do not babble until you have figured out what you are talking about. If uncertain, double-check with the Holy Spirit or ask the Father for the Holy Spirit if you haven’t met Bro yet. Bro is a super cool Dude and I unfortunately have to question whether you truly believe if you haven’t met Bro.</p>

<p>I kinda know why He prepared my welcoming party to the United Kingdom 11 years ago before I even bought the plane ticket to London and why He told me to speak to my friend’s father the Christian missionary in mainland China when I had my first calling during COVID-19. If I walked into any church today and opened my mouth for five minutes, I would not be going back again as an implicit mutually beneficial agreement and understanding. I have been dancing around both of my guides and they don’t read my posts. I still haven’t told my guide in mainland China that I’m a rampant homosexual because his opinions on the issue are quite clear-cut on social media. I brought up the possibility that the sex I have might not involve lust at least on my part to my welcoming party yesterday at church and I repeatedly emphasised the fact that I use the password in 1 John 4:2 and he does not know about my sex life, but his stance on the issue did not allow me the sufficient opportunity to state my case and ask for guidance or directions for me to better understand and hopefully resolve the dilemma.</p>

<p>I came across the verses in Matthew 9:13 and 12:7 when looking into the references from Luke 11:13 below. I merely wanted to better understand God in my relationship with Him after He called me, but people’s minds are so rigid and blind-sighted by their view and interpretation of the world that we no longer even allow each other to finish our sentences anymore before shouting our own opinions. Few even do enough homework or due diligence to consider other possibilities for their arguments before opening their mouths. I rarely met anyone willing to admit their lack of understanding or knowledge on any subject. I think I can stop tiptoeing around people at church.</p>

<p>I will start saying what’s in my mind and my heart for the first time in my life after allowing everyone to finish their sentences and always consider views from their perspective first as much as I could reasonably achieve within the given context. I will speak with a clear conscience and Bro as my witness. For the first time in my life, I no longer need other people’s input as weights in my probabilistic model view of the world. I have THE source of truth with a binary HMI and response latency lower than ChatGPT and I’m switching to a free-will compatible deterministic model view of the world. I don’t know how it works as much as infinitely many other known and unknown mysteries of our universe. Feel free to submit your queries to Boss Man if you desperately want to know. I have got some house cleaning to do first.</p>

<p>I asked the Holy Spirit if I could call Him Bro. Dude’s cool with that.</p>

<hr />

<p>Matthew 9:13</p>

<p>[13] Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Matthew 12:7</p>

<p>[7] And if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Luke 11:9–13</p>

<p>[9] And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. [10] For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. [11] What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; [12] or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? [13] If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Acts 2:37–40</p>

<p>[37] Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” [38] And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. [39] For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” [40] And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Genesis 11:1–9</p>

<p>The Tower of Babel</p>

<p>[1] Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. [2] And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. [3] And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. [4] Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.” [5] And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. [6] And the LORD said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. [7] Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another’s speech.” [8] So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. [9] Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth. (ESV)</p>

Personally, if you ask me if I would like to be the m-word, then my answer from the moment I was born to the end of time would be fuck no. And once again, I had a fucking blast minding my own business in the 27 years of my previous life until some motherfuckers came along, blew my first fucking proper holiday, and the people in my life continued to stab me in the back then left me to burn.</p>

<p>I started this blog to bitch and moan about shit I encountered on this journey because I put zero effort into inquiring about God’s business previously since I am a rampant homosexual, have more sexual partners in an hour every other day than the average straight person has in a lifetime on average, and thought God would hate someone like me based purely on religious stereotypes. I bought my first Bible back in late July last year after an ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID-19 essentially came true in real life, I thought it could be divine intervention and wondered in my heart whether we could bring God back, after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite Rosebay for giving them free full site Wi-Fi coverage and almost threw myself off the fifth-floor balcony right in front of my younger sister. I considered myself an agnostic and was never an atheist because I had no evidence for or against God’s existence. If He exists, God’s business is God’s business. I’m human and I mind my own business. Until people decided to fuck with my business, He decided to make my business His business, and now I’m going to fuck some people’s business up. To quote my Boss, now let that motherfucker burn. For the record, I was still messaging John Donald, the owner of Rosebay and my former business partner Meiling Wang on 6th February hoping they would repent. I’m done with that now and I will leave it to my Boss and what happens happens.</p>

<p>I described my relationship with the Holy Spirit including how we first met in an early post. It has been a very busy 21-week and 1-day journey since I first believed on 22 September 2024. No matter how insane my leaps of faith may appear to you, everything I did was confirmed both by the Holy Spirit and scripture. More often than not, I wasn’t even actively seeking confirmations, He just shoved scripture to my face one way or another when I needed it the most.</p>

<p>This past weekend, I had a moment of epiphany where I realised my interactions with the Holy Spirit are more or less the same as a binary HMI (Human Machine Interface). So I spent some time on the interface and now I just log in with the password in 1 John 4:2 before submitting queries to my Father. Latency is surprisingly low and much quicker than asking ChatGPT. ChatGPT annoys the heck out of me waiting for the answer to be spat out. Boss Man must have dope cloud infrastructure running up there. When I was sitting on the toilet attempting to do a number two before a shower earlier, I wondered if the Holy Spirit was Turing complete. Hence this post and the answer is yes for the theoretical computer scientists amongst you. I consider myself more of a coding monkey throwing half-assed MVPs together with whatever I can find. A lot more fun when you live life fast and furious. I managed to win the wager I proposed to my fellow CS Keblites by falling asleep on my tutor’s comfortable sofa during a tutorial. That’s how you get a third class in uni.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to say don’t worry about the m-word-related posts. I was hoping someone could slap me awake and show me evidence one way or another so that I knew I was delusional or mistaken. There was only one guy who needed to be convinced. Most of you did not give him a chance to finish his sentence before abandoning him.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you read my posts, you might be under the impression that I was suggesting or hinting that I may be a certain unspeakable m-word. Personally, if you ask me if I would like to be the m-word, then my answer from the moment I was born to the end of time would be fuck no. And once again, I had a fucking blast minding my own business in the 27 years of my previous life until some motherfuckers came along, blew my first fucking proper holiday, and the people in my life continued to stab me in the back then left me to burn.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Commandments and the Law</title><link href="https://hesaid.love/posts/on-commandments-and-the-law/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Commandments and the Law" /><published>2025-02-16T22:46:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-21T23:12:40+00:00</updated><id>https://hesaid.love/posts/on-commandments-and-the-law</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hesaid.love/posts/on-commandments-and-the-law/"><![CDATA[<p>I did more soul-searching over the last few days about the Ten Commandments and my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ’s commandments in the New Testament.</p>

<p>The top offender is stealing before my teenage years. I stole money from my parents to buy books and stole books on several occasions when my parents did not give me money. Other than that, I may have intentionally forgotten to return my headphones and some charging cables to my former employers.</p>

<p>The other more or less equally offending one is lying. I found out quite early on that lying is rarely the best strategy and selectively revealing information could more often than not achieve the same desirable outcome. The main difficulty with that strategy is you need to possess a superset of knowledge that entirely encompasses that of the person you are selectively revealing information.</p>

<p>If you try over-employment with 3-4 six-figure software engineering jobs simultaneously whilst being a single parent for two younger adult siblings, you would probably prefer selectively revealing information than lying any day. This is because complexity multiplies the more components you add to a complex system. One simple screwup could easily bring down the entire house of cards. Lying simply does not work unless you have a perfect memory and I more often than not can’t remember when I last brushed my teeth on this 21-week and 1-day journey.</p>

<p>Other than that, I have misdemeanours that I cannot remember because I am insane and nuts and I venture into a new field every couple of months just for fun and do a fair bit of study and research.</p>

<p><strong>I went through hell in three months to learn how to love and was willing to take a bullet for anyone on this earth regardless of what they did to me. What have you done to earn the right to judge who I am and make accusations about me? Just by reading more scripture?</strong></p>

<p>I do not know why since I don’t have all the answers, yet, but I find the following passages immensely fitting on this 21-week and 1-day journey after everyone kept slamming the door on my face despite I have done nothing but telling the truth. <strong>I have zero fucking desire to be the fucking messiah and be involved in this fucking saving the world shit and 9 times out of 10 I just want this wicked world to burn in hell for eternity for the evil shit people do.</strong> I walked off a fucking cliff in mainland China and laid down my dignity simply hoping everyone to repent given what I have seen and believe is to come. If you still do not believe after all of this, then I know without a doubt that you do not have God’s love in you. <strong id="definition-of-a-cunt">Especially if you had the fucking audacity to throw scripture in my face and accuse me of not knowing God’s love after I had served you faithfully for years without complaint going extraordinary lengths to satisfy every single fucking unreasonable demand you made, and on the first sight of trouble you kicked me out of my own fucking company and left me to burn. In my dictionary, that fits the definition of a fucking adulterous (unfaithful) cunt perfectly.</strong> If you are only interested in receiving glory from people, then will you at least do me the courtesy of having a coffee with me and we can have a purely rational conversation to walk you through what you are ignorant about using the knowledge I learned by studying undergraduate level mathematics, physics, computer science and philosophy and discuss the challenges we are facing?</p>

<p>John 5:30–47</p>

<p>Witnesses to Jesus</p>

<p>[30] “I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. [31] If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true. [32] There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true. [33] You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. [34] Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. [35] He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. [36] But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me. [37] And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen, [38] and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent. [39] You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, [40] yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. [41] I do not receive glory from people. [42] But I know that you do not have the love of God within you. [43] I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. [44] How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? [45] Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope. [46] For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. [47] But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?” (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>1 Corinthians 13:4–7</p>

<p>[4] Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant [5] or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; [6] it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. [7] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Before you accuse me of talking the talk and not walking the walking and not knowing love fucking once again simply because you consider the strong words I used in my writings rude and offensive, please contemplate first whether you would call Jesus rude and insist on His own way if you saw Him overturning the tables in the temple courts. I laid down my life and dignity and people did nothing except refer me to mental health services. What would you do if you were in my position? Have you even done the minimum due diligence to find out what happened? Most of the pastors and theologians I spoke to certainly did not bother.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>John 15:12–17</p>

<p>[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. [13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)</p>

<p>Edit: I sent <a href="https://dl.hesaid.love/due-diligence-email.pdf" target="_blank">this email</a> after this post was published. I have a couple more to-do items and then I believe according to the Old Testament, I have an announcement to make along with a couple of other miscellaneous items. <strong>Consider this tables overturned and you’ve been served.</strong></p>

<p>Edit 2: I just realised throwing scripture in my face and accusing me of not knowing God’s love after all that I had done especially after I walked off a cliff in mainland China to save everyone including the very person who did that from God’s wrath was effectively taking the LORD thy God’s name in vain, and rather unfortunately the Holy Spirit confirmed that to me with one of the strongest confirmations I have ever had to date. Once again, I take no pleasure in the demise of a friend from my previous life and I messaged her again to repent after publishing this post, but whatever happens happens. I will stay home and focus myself getting my adult streaming career started on Chaturbate and Stripchat and bring good news to my community.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did more soul-searching over the last few days about the Ten Commandments and my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ’s commandments in the New Testament.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Homosexuality</title><link href="https://hesaid.love/posts/on-homosexuality/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Homosexuality" /><published>2025-02-16T19:46:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-21T23:12:40+00:00</updated><id>https://hesaid.love/posts/on-homosexuality</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hesaid.love/posts/on-homosexuality/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>What about Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Leviticus 18:22</p>

<p>[22] You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Leviticus 20:13</p>

<p>[13] If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Judging by your commitment to Mosaic Law, you must be a faithful Israelite, a scarce find throughout history. I want to bring your attention to the following passages in Leviticus and please do let me know in advance when you plan on rounding up unbelievers and reinstating the death penalty.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Leviticus 20:10</p>

<p>Punishments for Sexual Immorality</p>

<p>[10] “If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Leviticus 24:16</p>

<p>[16] Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Leviticus 20:27</p>

<p>[27] “A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.” (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>If you are a “follower” of Jesus asking about Leviticus, I want to bring your attention to the following passages. Please do get in touch so that I can personally visit your humble abode and marvel at your magnificence if you have never told a lie before.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Leviticus 19:11</p>

<p>[11] “You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; you shall not lie to one another. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Romans 2:1</p>

<p>God’s Righteous Judgment</p>

<p>[1] Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Romans 2:17–24</p>

<p>[17] But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God [18] and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; [19] and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, [20] an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—[21] you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? [22] You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? [23] You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. [24] For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.” (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>Matthew 23:13</p>

<p>[13] “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>If you still want to ask about 1 Corinthians 6:9 or 1 Timothy 1:10 after the above, then I suspect you failed not only maths and sciences but also reading comprehension in school. Your teacher should have taught you to read the fucking context you fucking moron. Are you clean enough to single my community out and judge by labelling us an abomination and shutting the kingdom of heaven in our faces when we seek Him?</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>1 Corinthians 6:9–11</p>

<p>[9] Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, [10] nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. [11] And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>1 Timothy 1:8–11</p>

<p>[8] Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, [9] understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, [10] the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, [11] in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>If you are a faithful Israelite mentioned above, I would love to practice throwing stones at some blasphemous false teachers together once you have brought Mosaic Law and the death penalty back. I will go happily and willingly to meet my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ after the false teachers as a rampant homosexual, a regular at Horse Fair by Jamie HP, FickstutenMarkt in Berlin, and Lab.oratory in the basement of Berghain.</strong></p>
