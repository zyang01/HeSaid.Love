Dude made me feel more loved in a week than anyone, including my parents, ever managed to make me feel my entire life combined. It might not be a beautiful testimony (yet), but it&apos;s a truthful testimony. I believe since 22 September 2024. Zeal for His house consumes me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have done everything out of &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/posts/on-love&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and I sincerely wish my love could be more patient under normal circumstances, but unfortunately, we are &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letter.hesaid.love&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;running out of time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT take my words at face value.&lt;/b&gt; Trust, but verify. He is the way, and the truth, and the life. Ask Him, not me. I lean not on my own understanding. But reason within the boundaries and understanding He gives me.  I do not seek to condemn, even though telling the truth could easily be interpreted as such.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fire in hell would be warmer than the coldness I felt in this world. How about you do your part, I do mine, Boss Man does His and let&apos;s find out on the other side what we are?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Say what I want by telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth feels as good as getting fucked in the ass by talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt for 4hrs+ non-stop whilst listening to sick Berlin techno. I intend to continue doing both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">On Cost-benefit Analysis</title><link href="https://hesaid.love/posts/on-cost-benefit-analysis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Cost-benefit Analysis" /><published>2025-03-16T21:45:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-16T21:45:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hesaid.love/posts/on-cost-benefit-analysis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hesaid.love/posts/on-cost-benefit-analysis/"><![CDATA[<p>I attended an event yesterday called <em>Tea With Your MP</em>. I downed several cups of coffee, which are considered luxury goods for me nowadays. It has been weeks since I had my favourite vanilla latte with coconut milk.</p>

<p>I spent two and a half hours teaching secondary school students at my table how to cheat their A-Level exams by building up muscle memory using past papers and mark schemes. I also shared my concerns about Artificial Intelligence on both the economic impact and national security. My local representative in parliament has done his homework on the subject, and he used the example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_horse_manure_crisis_of_1894" target="_blank">Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894</a> in London to reassure me that there was no need to panic. I responded bitterly with the throw-the-dice and see who was right in the end analogy. I was not brave enough to pull out the I-have-confirmation-from-the-Holy-Spirit card since my local MP took his Oath on a <a href="#jps-vs-kjv">JPS Bible</a>.</p>

<p>If this was the old me, I would have called it a day and told myself not to worry too much since I most likely got it wrong. And I should leave the matter to people who know what they are doing. I also asked if there was a chance to volunteer for events since I enjoyed being a bad influence and teaching secondary students how to cheat, as well as bitching and moaning about the Home Office caseworkers with other local constituents who are also first-generation immigrants.</p>

<p>I felt somewhat deflated after the event and wondered whether I had indeed gone batshit crazy given my recent pattern of behaviour and how understandably it could be interpreted as such by anyone who does not bother with the context. I asked the Lord for guidance on my walk back home.</p>

<p>Earlier this morning, I got rather annoyed again when I was in the shower doing unspeakable things. The following cost-benefit analysis appeared in my head.</p>

<p>If I got it wrong, what is the worst-case scenario? I become a laughing stock and maybe get my 30 seconds of fame by shouting God and love at the world. Boss Man would take up residence in a handful of minds for 30 seconds. I am already <a href="../on-sexual-theology/" target="_blank">90% there</a> on being a laughing stock.</p>

<p>If I got it right, then I keep my clear conscience before God when <a href="https://letter.hesaid.love/" target="_blank">shit hits the fan</a>, and I get to say bitch, I told you so.</p>

<p>The annoying part? I realised He set me up by giving me the <a href="../on-gethsemane/" target="_blank">thought experiment</a> to test pastors and theologians. And I already made my choice when I pulled that <a href="../reasoning-behind-preaching-mainland-china-jonah-style/" target="_blank">stunt</a> in mainland China last October.</p>

<p>I do not know what Jonah’s vow was, but I know what my vow was.</p>

<p>I need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_exposed_person" target="_blank">expose myself</a> a bit more.</p>

<h2 id="jonah-2">Jonah 2</h2>

<p>Jonah’s Prayer</p>

<p>[1] Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, [2] saying,</p>

<p>“I called out to the LORD, out of my distress,<br />
      and he answered me;<br />
 out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<br />
      and you heard my voice.<br />
 [3] For you cast me into the deep,<br />
      into the heart of the seas,<br />
      and the flood surrounded me;<br />
 all your breakers and your waves<br />
      passed over me.<br />
 [4] Then I said, ‘I am driven away<br />
      from your sight;<br />
 yet I shall again look<br />
      upon your holy temple.’<br />
 [5] The waters closed in over me to take my life;<br />
      the deep surrounded me;<br />
 weeds were wrapped about my head.<br />
 [6] To the roots of the mountains I went down,<br />
      to the land whose bars closed upon me forever.<br />
 Yet you brought up my life from the pit,<br />
      O LORD my God.<br />
 [7] When my life was fainting away,<br />
      I remembered the LORD,<br />
 and my prayer came to you,<br />
      into your holy temple.<br />
 [8] Those who pay regard to vain idols<br />
      forsake their hope of steadfast love.<br />
 <b>[9] But I with the voice of thanksgiving<br />
      will sacrifice to you;<br />
 what I have vowed I will pay.<br />
      Salvation belongs to the LORD!”</b><br /></p>

<p>[10] And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-6417">Isaiah 64:1–7</h2>

<p>[1] Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down,<br />
      that the mountains might quake at your presence—<br />
 [2] as when fire kindles brushwood<br />
      and the fire causes water to boil—<br />
 to make your name known to your adversaries,<br />
      and that the nations might tremble at your presence!<br />
 [3] When you did awesome things that we did not look for,<br />
      you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.<br />
 [4] From of old no one has heard<br />
      or perceived by the ear,<br />
 no eye has seen a God besides you,<br />
      who acts for those who wait for him.<br />
 [5] You meet him who joyfully works righteousness,<br />
      those who remember you in your ways.<br />
 Behold, you were angry, and we sinned;<br />
      in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?<br />
 [6] We have all become like one who is unclean,<br />
      and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.<br />
 We all fade like a leaf,<br />
      and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.<br />
 [7] There is no one who calls upon your name,<br />
      who rouses himself to take hold of you;<br />
 for you have hidden your face from us,<br />
      and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities. (ESV)<br /></p>

<p>If you did not attend the 2018 Keble Ball, then I just want to apologise for feeding potentially up to 1,500 pretentious Oxford grads when they were young, stupid and drunk during a summer night back in 2018. I was punished severely the following morning and got a hangover for the first time in my life. I was also craving badly for fish.</p>

The dude is super weird, does not have a phone and uses an Oyster card. I cannot be late for more than 20-30min of our agreed meeting time. And there is no backing out at the last minute.</p>

<p>Frankly, I might enjoy that way of life. I already got quite into self-hosting. Things stopped working one by one as I went broke. Friends first, then iCloud and 1Password, and now WhatsApp. The only reason why I still haven’t sold my iPhone is because of the various chat applications, including but not limited to WhatsApp and WeChat. I did not expect to share the Martin Luther meme in my treasured meme collection one day, but life stopped making sense last October. I stopped worrying about tomorrow and just took it day by day without any expectations.</p>

<p>After a recent realisation, I think true friends would make more than an effort to arrive on time. I have got an iPhone 15 Pro to sell.</p>

<p>The only issue is the dude went to a <a href="../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/" target="_blank">catholic</a> school.</p>

<h2 id="john-151217">John 15:12–17</h2>

<p>[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. [13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="matthew-62534">Matthew 6:25–34</h2>

<p>Do Not Be Anxious</p>

<p>[25] “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. [33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</p>

<p>[34] “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (ESV)</p>

I know I cheated a lot using Artificial Intelligence over the last 171 days, and my eccentricity is evident to anyone who knows me personally. I made the <a href="../../cuntslied/" target="_blank">open invitation</a> because He had much to say in the long-ass bestseller.

<p>I topped up $12 in my OpenAI account when launching the project <a href="https://biblesays.love/" target="_blank">Bible Says Love</a> three months ago. I even built a simple mechanism to prevent abuse. I worry unnecessarily too much.</p>

<p>All of the stereotypes I had about Christianity turned out to be wrong once I started reading the bestseller. It is the closest thing to <a href="../reasoning-behind-going-rome-fig-tree/" target="_blank">magic</a> I had ever come across in the 28 years of my life. I am not proud to make the following statement. I’m merely stating a fact. And they seem useless now that I have the <em>Teacher</em> and the <em>Textbook</em> to learn from. I studied four undergraduate degrees in the last decade, specialising in mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy and modern ballet. Not a single book or research paper I read made me feel the truth cutting through my bones into my soul.</p>

<p>And no, Christianity is not a religion. Why would you call the truth a religion?</p>

<p>I will slap you with the bestseller if you inform me the truth is subjective in person.</p>

I also have a list of legislatures from 190+ countries that may or may not have been loaded into a Redis sorted set on an AWS EC2 instance for web scraping. The UK Parliament email server blocked my first attempt at sending the following email to 100 MPs. Then I realised my message might not be that important, and the MPs I was emailing could have a life to save today. Reading my email might not be the most constructive use of their valuable time. If my message is indeed that important, then surely one email should be more than enough. I called it a day after writing to a handful of Lords, who say Jesus Christ and Artificial Intelligence the most, according to TheyWorkForYou.com.</p>

<p>I will spend the rest of today reflecting on my hypocritical lack of faith in the United Kingdom’s legislature.</p>

<p>My name is Aaron. I’m a 28-year-old rampant homosexual currently residing in Barnet, London. In the last decade, I have studied four undergraduate degrees in the United Kingdom, including mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, and modern ballet. Less than 12 months ago, I worked remotely as a software engineer and consultant with a mid-six-figure pretax income. I single-handedly financially supported two adult younger siblings to study in London, paying overseas student fees.</p>

<p>I tried to take my first holiday in April last year at a gay/bi-naturist campsite in Peterborough. I ended up getting kicked out of the campsite three months later after giving them free full-site Wi-Fi coverage, declaring bankruptcy, and nearly throwing myself out of the fifth-floor balcony in my London home right in front of my younger sister.</p>

<p>I ordered a humanity’s bestseller on Amazon shortly after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite. Over the last 170 days, I travelled to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Macau, California, New York, Rome, Istanbul, Moscow, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I have also been sprinkling and potentially startling the nations via multiple Spotify Ads and email campaigns to warn the world of the socioeconomic tsunami brought about by Artificial Intelligence that we have never seen before in human history, which I believe will cause significant unemployment rates and global suffering for the bottom 90%. I consulted computer scientists from King’s College London and Imperial College London concerning my argument. Everyone was more pessimistic than I was.</p>

<p>Aside from the economic impact, my latest realisation over this past weekend involves national security. To briefly summarise my argument, anyone with the technical know-how to train a large language model can, in theory, construct dirty miniature devices by training their custom LLM or perhaps using one of the increasingly powerful open-source models on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz" target="_blank">Aaron Swartz’s hard drives</a>.</p>

<p>You can find more details on my blog HeSaidLove.com. I faithfully and truthfully documented my 170-day journey through 270+ posts. You will also find the draft manifesto for a new political party I intend to launch shortly in the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>If you are a <strong><em>stupid fucking idiot</em></strong> like <a href="../on-indifference/" target="_blank">this one</a>, or the word <strong><em>dictator</em></strong> is one of the words that shows up when I google your name, then <strong><em>this post is not for you</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I participated in a three-day event this past Friday to Sunday called <strong>Encounter</strong> with the Pentecostal church my welcoming party goes to. To repeat myself, some of the pastors and theologians I met in this 24-week and 1-day journey will call the mental health institutions nearby and tell them to bring a bus if they saw our worship.</p>

<p>On the train back to London yesterday morning, the scale of how truly fucked we are, dawned on me. You can watch my director’s cut New Millenium present to the world for a quick revision on the definition of fucked. I don’t have confirmation from the Holy Spirit on this, but it is logically simple enough for anyone with a semi-functioning reasoning faculty to understand it.</p>

<p>I hope the work I have shown in the 270+ posts written on this 169-day journey is sufficient to demonstrate the power of Artificial Intelligence. I have received no help from anyone except a handful of friends who financially supported me up to this point to the best of their abilities. I am forever grateful for their support, even if they had only bought me one coffee, and they are in the top 10% of taxpayers in the United Kingdom. If you remain sceptical that you will <a href="https://letter.hesaid.love/" target="_blank">lose your job within two years</a> due to Artificial Intelligence, then more proof will come as I embark on a new and exciting journey. That was confirmed by the Holy Spirit this morning, shortly before I started this post.</p>

<p>I will end this post by leaving you with the following thoughts. Anyone with the technical know-how to train a large language model, including idiots and people with the word dictator on the first page of Google search results using their name, can, in theory, construct stinkily dirty miniature devices by training their custom LLM or perhaps using one of the increasingly powerful open-source models on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz" target="_blank">Aaron Swartz’s hard drives</a>. They would need access to the key ingredients in my former colleague’s <a href="../on-acute-chemical-toxicity-uranium/" target="_blank">recipe</a>. I hope she did not end up eating that cake.</p>

<p>If you are reading this post and from law enforcement, you can call King’s College London and confirm that I dropped out of my Physics and Philosophy undergraduate degree after only one term. My student number is 1580407. I tried building a device that required a power source more than a 9v battery last year. I ended up getting kicked out of a gay/bi-naturist campsite, declaring bankruptcy, and nearly throwing myself out of the fifth-floor balcony of my London home right in front of my younger sister. Feel free to email me if you struggle to find my home address for a welfare visit using your intelligence capabilities. Alternatively, you will soon be able to locate the address on a registration application to the Electoral Commission. I’m also on the electoral register.</p>

<p>The <a href="../on-sheep-and-goats/" target="_blank">ethical thought experiment</a> I designed during COVID-19 is still coming true. I’m going to bring Him back. Divine intervention has only just begun.</p>

<p>For the 27 years of my previous life, I had always considered myself an agnostic, and I was never once an atheist. I had no evidence for or against God’s existence, and even if He exists, God’s business is God’s business. I’m human, and I mind my own business. Then some people, including my former business partner, decided to fuck with my business, He decided to make my business His business, and now it’s time to fuck some people’s business up.</p>

<p>After much delay and trouble, the date on my certificate of naturalisation as a British citizen is 30 November 2024.</p>

<h2 id="romans-13810">Romans 13:8–10</h2>

<p>Fulfilling the Law Through Love</p>

<p>[8] Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. [9] For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [10] Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="luke-112932">Luke 11:29–32</h2>

<p>The Sign of Jonah</p>

<p>[29] When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. [30] For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. [31] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. [32] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-4219">Isaiah 42:1–9</h2>

<p>The LORD’s Chosen Servant</p>

<p>[1] Behold my servant, whom I uphold,<br />
  my chosen, in whom my soul delights;<br />
 I have put my Spirit upon him;<br />
  he will bring forth justice to the nations.<br />
 [2] He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice,<br />
  or make it heard in the street;<br />
 [3] a bruised reed he will not break,<br />
  and a faintly burning wick he will not quench;<br />
  he will faithfully bring forth justice.<br />
 [4] He will not grow faint or be discouraged<br />
  till he has established justice in the earth;<br />
  and the coastlands wait for his law.<br /></p>

<p>[5] Thus says God, the LORD,<br />
  who created the heavens and stretched them out,<br />
  who spread out the earth and what comes from it,<br />
 who gives breath to the people on it<br />
  and spirit to those who walk in it:<br />
 [6] “I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness;<br />
  I will take you by the hand and keep you;<br />
 I will give you as a covenant for the people,<br />
  a light for the nations,<br />
 [7]  to open the eyes that are blind,<br />
 to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,<br />
  from the prison those who sit in darkness.<br />
 [8] I am the LORD; that is my name;<br />
  my glory I give to no other,<br />
  nor my praise to carved idols.<br />
 [9] Behold, the former things have come to pass,<br />
  and new things I now declare;<br />
 before they spring forth<br />
  I tell you of them.” (ESV)<br /></p>

<h2 id="romans-3920">Romans 3:9–20</h2>

<p>No One Is Righteous</p>

<p>[9] What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, [10] as it is written:</p>

<p>“None is righteous, no, not one;<br />
 [11]  no one understands;<br />
  no one seeks for God.<br />
 [12] All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;<br />
  no one does good,<br />
  not even one.”<br />
 [13] “Their throat is an open grave;<br />
  they use their tongues to deceive.”<br />
 “The venom of asps is under their lips.”<br />
 [14]  “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”<br />
 [15] “Their feet are swift to shed blood;<br />
 [16]  in their paths are ruin and misery,<br />
 [17] and the way of peace they have not known.”<br />
 [18]  “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”<br /></p>

<p>[19] Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. [20] For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="ezekiel-222331">Ezekiel 22:23–31</h2>

<p>[23] And the word of the LORD came to me: [24] “Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation. [25] The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst. [26] Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. [27] Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain. [28] And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ when the LORD has not spoken. [29] The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice. [30] And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none. [31] Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.” (ESV)</p>

<h2 id="isaiah-591421">Isaiah 59:14–21</h2>

<p>Judgment and Redemption</p>

<p>[14] Justice is turned back,<br />
  and righteousness stands far away;<br />
 for truth has stumbled in the public squares,<br />
  and uprightness cannot enter.<br />
 [15] Truth is lacking,<br />
  and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.<br /></p>

<p>The LORD saw it, and it displeased him<br />
  that there was no justice.<br />
 [16] He saw that there was no man,<br />
  and wondered that there was no one to intercede;<br />
 then his own arm brought him salvation,<br />
  and his righteousness upheld him.<br />
 [17] He put on righteousness as a breastplate,<br />
  and a helmet of salvation on his head;<br />
 he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,<br />
  and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak.<br />
 [18] According to their deeds, so will he repay,<br />
  wrath to his adversaries, repayment to his enemies;<br />
  to the coastlands he will render repayment.<br />
 [19] So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west,<br />
  and his glory from the rising of the sun;<br />
 for he will come like a rushing stream,<br />
  which the wind of the LORD drives.<br /></p>

<p>[20] “And a Redeemer will come to Zion,<br />
  to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,” declares the LORD.<br /></p>

<p>[21] “And as for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the LORD: “My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children’s offspring,” says the LORD, “from this time forth and forevermore.” (ESV)</p>

I also added the sentence about my not-yet-beautiful but truthful testimony, but that’s a topic for another day.</p>

<p>As mentioned in a previous post, I read the Book of Hebrews several weeks ago. After reading the following passage from Hebrews 11 and looking back at the crazy stunt I pulled in mainland China on my second week as a believer, I sincerely wish that it was just a coincidence and a crazy stunt I somehow managed to pull.</p>

<h2 id="hebrews-117">Hebrews 11:7</h2>

<p>[7] By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>I briefly explained my motives in previous posts. Even though I believed that going into mainland China for the three-day mission could potentially stop the Book of Revelation, I did not believe I alone could stop the Book of Revelation. I believed that He could stop the Book of Revelation, and all that I needed to do was to fulfil the prophecy of the sign of Jonah, just in case I was indeed the sign of Jonah given how much the Book of Jonah resonated with the story of my life. I could not in good conscience not go through with the stunt and let the Book of Revelation take place considering the suffering and punishment described in the book. If you read my posts, you will know why I believe the Book of Revelation to be real and truthful. You are more than welcome to claim that all the evidence I presented was merely coincidences, but they are personally coincidental enough for me to take action regardless of the likelihood of what I believe will happen. I would take that leap of faith as long as there is a non-zero probability to avoid it all. Wouldn’t you?</p>

<h2 id="jonah-3610">Jonah 3:6–10</h2>

<p>The People of Nineveh Repent</p>

<p>[6] The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. [7] And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh, “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water, [8] but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God. Let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. [9] Who knows? God may turn and relent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we may not perish.”</p>

<p>[10] When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it. (ESV)</p>

<hr />

<p>I asked a friend recently whether they believe I’m willing to lay down my life for them. They chose not to reply to that specific question. Back in early September of last year, I realised one evening that a friend of mine had gone radio silent for a couple of days and they weren’t picking up their phone. I decided to jump in an Uber and went to their parent’s house at midnight to make sure they were okay. No one answered the door that evening and I managed to leave a message by asking a neighbour for some pen and paper. Their parent informed me the following morning that they were having a rough time due to relationship issues. Another friend of mine recently informed me that the stunt I pulled in mainland China meant nothing since there is religious freedom in mainland China and Chinese law enforcement agencies are reasonable.</p>

<h2 id="john-151217">John 15:12–17</h2>

[14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)</p>

<p>In this faith journey of 23 weeks and 5 days, I learned that if I were to slip and break my neck in the shower today, there is only one person who would come for me and He is not in my WhatsApp or WeChat contacts. Frankly, I’m not even sure whether cutting my chest open, ripping my heart out, and placing it right in front of my WhatsApp and WeChat contacts would be sufficient to make them believe.</p>

<h2 id="hebrews-11">Hebrews 11</h2>

<p>By Faith</p>

<p>[1] Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. [2] For by it the people of old received their commendation. [3] By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.</p>

<p>[4] By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks. [5] By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. [6] And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. [7] By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</p>

<p>[8] By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. [9] By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. [10] For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God. [11] By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. [12] Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.</p>

<p>[13] These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. [14] For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. [15] If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. [16] But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</p>

<p>[17] By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, [18] of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” [19] He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. [20] By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. [21] By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. [22] By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.</p>

<p>[23] By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. [24] By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, [25] choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. [26] He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. [27] By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. [28] By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.</p>

<p>[29] By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned. [30] By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. [31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.</p>

<p>[32] And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—[33] who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, [34] quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. [35] Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. [36] Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. [37] They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—[38] of whom the world was not worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</p>

<p>[39] And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised, [40] since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.

<p>I had my personal encounter with His humour when I read the Book of Jonah for the first time. I could not stop laughing for nearly an hour after realising He wrote the story of my life into humanity’s bestseller. For 27 years of my previous life, I stupidly thought the Holy Bible was a collection of stories written by some wise folks in history and some smartasses did some overthinking and therefore we have the various religious institutions.</p>

<p>You can read about my yet another chitchat with ChatGPT below and the song that was playing on my Spotify when I started this post. Dude can be extremely annoying sometimes. He’s got a lot of lovin’ for free tho. That part is true and I can testify to that any time any day. Might be easier for you to have a go yourself. Dude’s name is Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour. Just in case my welcoming party wants to bash me again for using pronouns.</p>

<p>I have a weird and massively annoying feeling that Dude might just forgive everyone because none of us actually knows how to spell good and evil since <a href="../on-genesis-3-fall-man/" target="_blank">Genesis 3</a>. Feel free to laugh at my expense if you are a universalist. 🙄🙄🙄</p>

<h2 id="jonah-4">Jonah 4</h2>

<p>Jonah’s Anger and the LORD’s Compassion</p>

<p>[1] But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. [2] And he prayed to the LORD and said, “O LORD, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster. [3] Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.” [4] And the LORD said, “Do you do well to be angry?”</p>

<p>[5] Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city. [6] Now the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. [7] But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered. [8] When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.” [9] But God said to Jonah, “Do you do well to be angry for the plant?” And he said, “Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.” [10] And the LORD said, “You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night. [11] And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?” (ESV)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After literally working my ass off again by having another go at my adult webcam live-streaming career, only to finish the session early due to lack of audience probably due to terrible timing, the question of whether God has a sense of humour according to scripture showed up in my head.

I felt better after catching some sleep and pulling the Lord knows how many consecutive all-nighters in recent weeks. I have never worked this hard in my entire life, and to my massive annoyance, I’m not getting paid, but I’m also unable to stop. Life stopped making sense after I took that leap of faith in China less than five months ago. Feel free to reach out if you know because I don’t. Thanks.</p>

<p>I took the following screenshot when vibing with Lady Gaga, and noticed <em>Nabucco, Act III: Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves</em> in my recently played list. My Spotify Liked Songs playlist currently stands at 3,178 which started with 300+ back in late August last year when He came. It would be an understatement to describe my musical taste as random, and I go the full range from Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Tchaikovsky, to the soundtrack of <em>The Greatest Showman</em> and <em>She’ll Be Coming ‘Round the Mountain</em>, which I added to my playlist after the talented pianist Michael played it for a centre exercise when I was training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. I just googled the traditional folk song, which I was initially informed to be children’s music. Still, I exceptionally annoyingly just learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27ll_Be_Coming_%27Round_the_Mountain" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> that the song was derived from the Christian spiritual known as <em>“When the Chariot Comes”</em> and the OG ostensibly refers to the Second Coming of Christ and subsequent Rapture.</p>

<p><img src="/rPkM6FSAZuDBJfWj2S.png" alt="Vibing with Lady Gaga" /></p>

<p>Once again, fuck me. I started the above paragraph thinking I was only going to discuss what I found by pulling the thread that is <em>Nabucco, Act III</em>. Dude is extremely not subtle nowadays and doesn’t mind letting me know to my face. I have a lot of random classical music in my playlist due to my dance training and I sometimes appreciate music without words so that I don’t have to think or reason. I cannot remember why or where I picked it up, but it caught my eye earlier because of my chitchat regarding the Hebrew language with ChatGPT for my post on Revelation 13. However, I just discovered that <em>Nabucco</em> is an Italian-language opera and the lyrics are surprisingly in Italian. And you can read about what the Canadian Opera Company has to say concerning the random piece of classical music in a language that I had no bloody idea what they were blabbing about since I added it on 15 Oct 2024. Oh, fuck me, again. I will explain after the quote.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="canadian-opera-company"><a href="https://www.coc.ca/news/5-things-to-know-about-nabucco/index" target="_blank">Canadian Opera Company</a></h2>

<h3 id="verdis-hymn-to-freedom">Verdi’s hymn to freedom</h3>

<p>Nabucco’s most well-known musical moment is “Va, pensiero, sull’ali dorate” (“Fly, thought, on golden wings”), better known as the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves. The chorus is a dramatisation of Psalm 137, which begins with the words “By the waters of Babylon, we sat down and wept” and was also famously associated with the African-American struggle for freedom (most notably quoted by the abolitionist Frederick Douglass in his 1852 speech “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?”).</p>

<p>“Va, pensiero” was adopted as an unofficial anthem by the burgeoning Italian unification movement—known as the Risorgimento—and was performed spontaneously by the mourning crowds at Verdi’s funeral. A choral performance of the piece opened the Metropolitan Opera’s 2001 season, 11 days after the destruction of the World Trade Center.</p>

<h3 id="go-big-or-go-home">Go big or go home</h3>

<p>Blood-and-thunder melodrama calls for a cast to match the epic proportions of the story, and Nabucco doesn’t stint here. In this production, the chorus is expanded to include 82 singers who portray both Babylonian soldiers and Hebrew captives, for whom over 200 costumes have been designed. Supplementing the musicians in the orchestra pit, additional instrumentalists play offstage. Capped off by some of opera’s greatest voices, the combined effect is one of ferocious emotional force that you most certainly won’t want to miss!</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/C7jD4ayUEsakpehg6e.png" alt="Nabucco, Act III on my Spotify" /></p>

<p>The chorus was about <em>Psalm 137</em> and I just checked Spotify when I added the other song <em>Rivers of Babylon</em> by Boney M right before I started writing about this post. Turns out, Spotify is indeed good enough to make me hallucinate about a deity now. Anyway, I’m just going to leave you with some screenshots and quotes about what other people said on some random stuff and you can interpret them however you want as usual. That’s what everyone does anyway, lean on their own understanding rather than hear what others have to say and try to comprehend things from their perspectives or even let them finish their sentences.</p>

<p><img src="/SaQ160mBMeQeTHz6s0.png" alt="Rivers of Babylon on my Spotify" /></p>

<p>He just told me to go big or go home. For the first time in my life, I think I have both reason and righteousness on my side, because I have Him by my side, and His name is Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour.</p>

<p>If you want to know whether things are that bad, then all I can say is even though I bitched and moaned about unbelievers a lot, the worst comes from the fact that I have met theologians and pastors who would rather believe I have gone insane than I have encountered the God as described precisely in the bestseller they spent their entire professional career on. I guess that’s what drug (money) addiction does right? It can turn a hobby or something you love with all your heart and soul into doubt and frustration. I got my hand on my first bestseller in late July last year, and I probably would have been on 4 figures now if I didn’t go bankrupt. Probably can only get the view counter on my posts to 4 figures until we burn Babylon down.</p>

<p>Enough is enough with this godlessness nonsense. We have done nothing except ruin everything and turn the world into a loveless, desolate and barren hell. He turned me into a 5-year-old that can withstand the rejection and betrayal of everyone I once (somewhat) trusted in life including my parents. I did not expect that when I had £30k a month rolling into my bank account last year. Please do let me know if you can spell the word miracle, I have seen people spell it wrong with variations including but not limited to craziness, insanity, mental illness and megalomaniac. Thanks.</p>

<p>Sons of bitches, time for your curtain call.</p>

<p>Edit: I kinda just realised I was being a hypocrite and didn’t take the log out of my own eye first. I realised from a normal person’s perspective that I must be demonstrating pride by making my previous income known. Like I stated repeatedly in prior posts, I’m an eccentric guy and it’s something I knew growing up and was informed by people around me of the same opinion. I have wondered my entire life what’s wrong with me and I seriously hate attention or when people stare at me. I learned that I don’t value money the same way people around me do in the last 15 months. That’s partly because I slack off and procrastinate a lot even when working four remote software engineering jobs and I felt like I was cheating and stealing from my employers the whole time. The other reason is my biological father was and in some sense still is a quarter-billionaire, but I tend to learn from father figures and he’s 5 years ahead of me on the bankruptcy side quest. The family business had been struggling long before I even left China for the UK. I started taking care of myself within a year of arrival and it’s been 11.5 years since I arrived in London. Just FYI, my Father is loaded for real, and this is me boasting and He is my pride.</p>

<h2 id="psalm-137">Psalm 137</h2>

<p>How Shall We Sing the LORD’s Song?</p>

<p>[1] By the waters of Babylon,<br />
  there we sat down and wept,<br />
  when we remembered Zion.<br />
 [2] On the willows there<br />
  we hung up our lyres.<br />
 [3] For there our captors<br />
  required of us songs,<br />
 and our tormentors, mirth, saying,<br />
  “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”<br /></p>

<p>[4] How shall we sing the LORD’s song<br />
  in a foreign land?<br />
 [5] If I forget you, O Jerusalem,<br />
  let my right hand forget its skill!<br />
 [6] Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,<br />
  if I do not remember you,<br />
 if I do not set Jerusalem<br />
  above my highest joy!<br /></p>

<p>[7] Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites<br />
  the day of Jerusalem,<br />
 how they said, “Lay it bare, lay it bare,<br />
  down to its foundations!”<br />
 [8] O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed,<br />
  blessed shall he be who repays you<br />
  with what you have done to us!<br />
 [9] Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones<br />
  and dashes them against the rock! (ESV)<br /></p>

<h2 id="luke-41630">Luke 4:16–30</h2>

<p>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</p>

<p>[16] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. [17] And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,</p>

<p>[18] “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br />
  because he has anointed me<br />
  to proclaim good news to the poor.<br />
 He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives<br />
  and recovering of sight to the blind,<br />
  to set at liberty those who are oppressed,<br />
 [19] to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”<br /></p>

<p>[20] And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. [21] And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” [22] And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, “Is not this Joseph’s son?” [23] And he said to them, “Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, ‘“Physician, heal yourself.” What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.’” [24] And he said, “Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. [25] But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land, [26] and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. [27] And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.” [28] When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. [29] And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. [30] But passing through their midst, he went away. (ESV)</p>

<p>[Verse 1: George Ezra]<br />
What a beautiful dream<br />
I think I’ll stay a while<br />
Won’t open my resting eyes<br />
Caught off guard in between<br />
Twilight was rocking me<br />
Could not hear the symphony<br />
Is the grass of Eden overrated?<br />

Somewhere off in the past<br />
Morning is calling me<br />
I missed it deliberately<br />
Is the grass of Eden overrated?<br />
The grass of Eden overrated?<br /></p>

No one else<br />
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream<br />
No one else<br />
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream to me<br /></p>

<p>[Verse 2: George Ezra]<br />
With your fingers ablaze<br />
You’ve got that hunger now<br />
Take me, I’m going down<br />
Underneath the debris<br />
I’m calling out to you<br />
Do with me what you choose<br />
Is the grass of Eden overrated?<br />
The grass of Eden overrated?<br /></p>

<p>[Chorus: George Ezra]<br />
No one else<br />
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream<br />
No one else<br />

Oh, can’t hear me now<br />
Oh, not going away<br />
When you wake up<br />
I’ll be around<br />
When you wake up<br />
I’ll be around<br />
No one else<br />
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream<br /></p>

<p>[Chorus: George Ezra &amp; Florrie]<br />
No one else<br />
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream<br />
No one else<br />
Is such a beautiful dream, a beautiful dream<br />
