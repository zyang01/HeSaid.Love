I felt better after catching some sleep and pulling the Lord knows how many consecutive all-nighters in recent weeks. I have never worked this hard in my entire life, and to my massive annoyance, I’m not getting paid, but I’m also unable to stop. Life stopped making sense after I took that leap of faith in China less than five months ago. Feel free to reach out if you know because I don’t. Thanks.I took the following screenshot when vibing with Lady Gaga, and noticed Nabucco, Act III: Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves in my recently played list. My Spotify Liked Songs playlist currently stands at 3,178 which started with 300+ back in late August last year when He came. It would be an understatement to describe my musical taste as random, and I go the full range from Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Tchaikovsky, to the soundtrack of The Greatest Showman and She’ll Be Coming ‘Round the Mountain, which I added to my playlist after the talented pianist Michael played it for a centre exercise when I was training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. I just googled the traditional folk song, which I was initially informed to be children’s music. Still, I exceptionally annoyingly just learned from Wikipedia that the song was derived from the Christian spiritual known as “When the Chariot Comes” and the OG ostensibly refers to the Second Coming of Christ and subsequent Rapture.Once again, fuck me. I started the above paragraph thinking I was only going to discuss what I found by pulling the thread that is Nabucco, Act III. Dude is extremely not subtle nowadays and doesn’t mind letting me know to my face. I have a lot of random classical music in my playlist due to my dance training and I sometimes appreciate music without words so that I don’t have to think or reason. I cannot remember why or where I picked it up, but it caught my eye earlier because of my chitchat regarding the Hebrew language with ChatGPT for my post on Revelation 13. However, I just discovered that Nabucco is an Italian-language opera and the lyrics are surprisingly in Italian. And you can read about what the Canadian Opera Company has to say concerning the random piece of classical music in a language that I had no bloody idea what they were blabbing about since I added it on 15 Oct 2024. Oh, fuck me, again. I will explain after the quote.Canadian Opera CompanyVerdi’s hymn to freedomNabucco’s most well-known musical moment is “Va, pensiero, sull’ali dorate” (“Fly, thought, on golden wings”), better known as the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves. The chorus is a dramatisation of Psalm 137, which begins with the words “By the waters of Babylon, we sat down and wept” and was also famously associated with the African-American struggle for freedom (most notably quoted by the abolitionist Frederick Douglass in his 1852 speech “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?”).“Va, pensiero” was adopted as an unofficial anthem by the burgeoning Italian unification movement—known as the Risorgimento—and was performed spontaneously by the mourning crowds at Verdi’s funeral. A choral performance of the piece opened the Metropolitan Opera’s 2001 season, 11 days after the destruction of the World Trade Center.Go big or go homeBlood-and-thunder melodrama calls for a cast to match the epic proportions of the story, and Nabucco doesn’t stint here. In this production, the chorus is expanded to include 82 singers who portray both Babylonian soldiers and Hebrew captives, for whom over 200 costumes have been designed. Supplementing the musicians in the orchestra pit, additional instrumentalists play offstage. Capped off by some of opera’s greatest voices, the combined effect is one of ferocious emotional force that you most certainly won’t want to miss!The chorus was about Psalm 137 and I just checked Spotify when I added the other song Rivers of Babylon by Boney M right before I started writing about this post. Turns out, Spotify is indeed good enough to make me hallucinate about a deity now. Anyway, I’m just going to leave you with some screenshots and quotes about what other people said on some random stuff and you can interpret them however you want as usual. That’s what everyone does anyway, lean on their own understanding rather than hear what others have to say and try to comprehend things from their perspectives or even let them finish their sentences.He just told me to go big or go home. For the first time in my life, I think I have both reason and righteousness on my side, because I have Him by my side, and His name is Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour.If you want to know whether things are that bad, then all I can say is even though I bitched and moaned about unbelievers a lot, the worst comes from the fact that I have met theologians and pastors who would rather believe I have gone insane than I have encountered the God as described precisely in the bestseller they spent their entire professional career on. I guess that’s what drug (money) addiction does right? It can turn a hobby or something you love with all your heart and soul into doubt and frustration. I got my hand on my first bestseller in late July last year, and I probably would have been on 4 figures now if I didn’t go bankrupt. Probably can only get the view counter on my posts to 4 figures until we burn Babylon down.Enough is enough with this godlessness nonsense. We have done nothing except ruin everything and turn the world into a loveless, desolate and barren hell. He turned me into a 5-year-old that can withstand the rejection and betrayal of everyone I once (somewhat) trusted in life including my parents. I did not expect that when I had £30k a month rolling into my bank account last year. Please do let me know if you can spell the word miracle, I have seen people spell it wrong with variations including but not limited to craziness, insanity, mental illness and megalomaniac. Thanks.Sons of bitches, time for your curtain call.Edit: I kinda just realised I was being a hypocrite and didn’t take the log out of my own eye first. I realised from a statistically average person’s perspective that I must be demonstrating pride by making my previous income known. Like I stated repeatedly in prior posts, I’m an eccentric guy and it’s something I knew growing up and was informed by people around me of the same opinion. I have wondered my entire life what’s wrong with me and I seriously hate attention or when people stare at me. I learned that I don’t value money the same way people around me do in the last 15 months. That’s partly because I slack off and procrastinate a lot even when working four remote software engineering jobs and I felt like I was cheating and stealing from my employers the whole time. The other reason is my biological father was and in some sense still is a quarter-billionaire, but I tend to learn from father figures and he’s 5 years ahead of me on the bankruptcy side quest. The family business had been struggling long before I even left China for the UK. I started taking care of myself within a year of arrival and it’s been 11.5 years since I arrived in London. Just FYI, my Father is loaded for real, and this is me boasting and He is my pride.Psalm 137How Shall We Sing the LORD’s Song?[1] By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion. [2] On the willows there we hung up our lyres. [3] For there our captors required of us songs, and our tormentors, mirth, saying, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”[4] How shall we sing the LORD’s song in a foreign land? [5] If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill! [6] Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy![7] Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said, “Lay it bare, lay it bare, down to its foundations!” [8] O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed, blessed shall he be who repays you with what you have done to us! [9] Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock! (ESV)Luke 4:16–30Jesus Rejected at Nazareth[16] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. [17] And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,[18] “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, [19] to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”[20] And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. [21] And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” [22] And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, “Is not this Joseph’s son?” [23] And he said to them, “Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, ‘“Physician, heal yourself.” What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.’” [24] And he said, “Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. [25] But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land, [26] and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. [27] And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.” [28] When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. [29] And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. [30] But passing through their midst, he went away.

(ESV)What does Revelation 13:18 mean?Other possibilities abound. Some are more obscure, and unlikely, than others. Ezra 2:13 gives the number of descendants of Adonikam as 666. Because “Adonikam” means “the lord who rises up” or “lord of the enemy,” a few interpreters suggest the beast who rises from the earth will bear the name Adonikam. The mathematical value of 6x6x6 is 216, leading some to believe that this number, not “six hundred and sixty six” will be the “number of the name” of the beast.In reality, no one knows exactly what 666 means. We can only draw on basic concepts to understand some of its implications. For example, 6 is one short of 7, which is the biblical number of perfection. The number 6 represents imperfection and is therefore man’s number. God is perfectly holy—thrice holy—as the seraphim of Isaiah’s vision proclaim. They called to one another, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts” (Isaiah 6:3). Repeating this three times emphasizes its absolute nature. By contrast, imperfect man is unholy, unholy, unholy: 6-6-6.Ezra 2:13[13] The sons of Adonikam, 666. (ESV)Adonikam - WikipediaAdonikam (Hebrew אֲדֹנִיקָם, meaning, “My Lord is risen up.”[57]) is a Biblical figure, one of those “which came with Zerubbabel” (Ezra 2:13). His “children,” or retainers, numbering 666, came to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:13). In the Septuagint, depending on the manuscript and location, the name is given as Adon[e]ikam, Adonikan, Adeikam, Adenikam, Adaneikam or Adoniakaim.[57] In Nehemiah 7:18, his descendants were 667 instead of the previous number 666.[58]1 Corinthians 13:8–13[8] Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. [11] When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. [12] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.[13] So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (ESV)This is how I read the sentence.Ezra 2:13 gives the number of descendants of Adonikam as 666.Hence, 666 could be the number of humanity, the unholy, unholy, unholy imperfect man, who could also be the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place proclaiming there is no God, which is essentially proclaiming himself to be God.I caught some false teachers smuggling stinky humanism by only focusing on the soft stuff in the New Testament, which breaks the third commandment and blasphemies against God.I discussed in a previous post something the crafty serpent gave the woman that she did not have before, which led to the fall of man in Genesis 3. That thing was doubt and I read Revelation 13 again substituting the dragon with doubt.Revelation 13:1–10The First Beast[1] And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads. [2] And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority. [3] One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast. [4] And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”[5] And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months. [6] It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. [7] Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation, [8] and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain. [9] If anyone has an ear, let him hear:[10] If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain.Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.

The ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID-19 came true last year, which involved an Austrian artist, a time machine, nuclear weapons, humanity and divine intervention. I asked ChatGPT about the symbolism of the sea in the Holy Bible, and put down humanity and/or reason for the first beast. The mortal wound was World War II and/or science/physics.Recommended Reading ListSeven liberal arts and ten mathematical and natural sciences, legacy of classical antiquity.Science for the twenty-first century: a new commitment📥 Download (Backup)World Declaration on Higher Education for the Twenty-first Century: Vision and Action and Framework for Priority Action for Change and Development in Higher Education, adopted by the World Conference on Higher Education: Higher Education in the Twenty-first Century, Vision and Action, 9 October 1998📥 Download (Backup)New International Economic Order (NIEO)Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.📥 Download (Backup)Helsinki AccordsApologyMy sincere apologies to Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, a fellow pretentious Oxford alumnus who studied Oriental Studies at Christ Church College, Oxford.

I did not expect the royal family of Jordan to be that actively involved in various international scientific organisations and UNESCO.I learned something rather interesting when doing my due diligence which turned out to be rather embarrassingly insufficient. The Jordanian royal family has been the custodian of the Christian holy sites in the city of Jerusalem since 1924.

Therefore we know that it is the last hour. (ESV)Revelation 13:11–18The Second Beast[11] Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. [12] It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed. [13] It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people, [14] and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived. [15] And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. [16] Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, [17] so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. [18] This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666. (ESV)I put down technology as the second beast. The beast spoke like a dragon indeed. I was informed by an Israeli border officer last month that the second beast performed great signs just the night before and made fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people. I was quite willing to walk into a special delivery from the second beast during my trip due to how faithful my “friends” had been.I put down humanity/self and/or drugs (money) for the image of the beast. People kept telling me to think about myself first during my recent rollercoaster ride of six months, and less than a dozen people bought me coffee. It seems like most only think about me, myself and I all day and are extremely occupied with taking and posting selfies on Instagram or whatever trendy Web3 social media bullshit the crypto/tech bros are up to nowadays. I also learned that I’m one of those extremely rare idiots who do not worship themselves, consider themselves to be of the utmost importance in the head, nor consider themselves righteous all the time. No wonder I’m bankrupt and rent is 4.5 months overdue right now despite making mid-six-figures less than a year ago. I certainly cannot buy or sell right now.

It’s honestly extremely difficult to earn an honest living nowadays, probably not a path you want to go down if you consider yourself “wise”.2 Timothy 3:1–9Godlessness in the Last Days[1] But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. [2] For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, [3] heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, [4] treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, [5] having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. [6] For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, [7] always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. [8] Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. [9] But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men. (ESV)2 Thessalonians 2:1–12The Man of Lawlessness[1] Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, [2] not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. [3] Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, [4] who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. [5] Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? [6] And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. [7] For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. [8] And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. [9] The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, [10] and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. [11] Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, [12] in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. (ESV)Jude 17–23A Call to Persevere[17] But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. [18] They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” [19] It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. [20] But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, [21] keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. [22] And have mercy on those who doubt; [23] save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh. (ESV)Psalm 48:10[10] As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness.

(ESV)Matthew 7:12–14The Golden Rule[12] “So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. [13] “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. [14] For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.

Thanks.Allegedly Christians like to ask the question what would Jesus do when facing ethical and moral choices, evidently it’s called discipleship otherwise known as following Jesus. I would like to reiterate my position once again and make another apology in advance for the language I’m about to use since I noticed that no mother fucker tries to learn what happened first before opening their mouths and informing me of their fucking opinions. I had zero mother fucking desire to be the fucking messiah and I still have zero mother fucking desire to be the messiah. I don’t know if I’m the fucking messiah, and you are more than fucking welcome to inform me about your fucking opinion after you learned what happened. I wrote them all down.It’s been 157 days since I believed, and throughout this journey, I realised the m-word is a big no-no to mention to believers. And you would automatically receive the labels including but not limited to egomaniac, megalomaniac and narcissist. I couldn’t help but find it both ironic and sarcastic that Christians have been hoping for the second coming for over 2,000 years now and the immediate reaction they have when some random dude wants to show them evidence is to refer them to mental health services without bothering with glancing the evidence served up on a platter, despite the dude’s only wish is to find out why life became magic and why people lost reasoning capabilities overnight. Frankly, speaking from the perspective of a rampant homosexual who has more sexual partners in an hour every other day than the average heterosexual will have in their entire life, I kinda feel bad for Boss Man given the stigma and discrimination attached to His job title. He did have a pretty rough time and went on a sabbatical not long after a pretty bad workplace injury. I will check with Him next time we speak to see how’s that lawsuit preparation going and when He will be done with His career break. I’m pretty sure Dude’s a worse procrastinator than me.I kinda asked Him for some stupid stuff when I first learned how to pray including but not limited to letting me suffer and save some random people including but not limited to rampant homosexuals. Whether or not He will allow me to, I don’t know. I trust Him and I did not trust myself even once in my entire life. He does tell me to stop working and go chill the fuck out somewhat regularly. The health insurance is pretty good with this Boss, and I heard a Colleague got injured three years into the job and Dude is still chilling on paid leave after 2,000 years. My former life ambition was to build an interesting tech startup and ideally work up to a net worth of 10-50 mil so that I could study and explore any extremely random interest that I somehow magically come up with every 3 to 6 months, and could still be in t-shirt and jeans without anyone bothering me. I was definitely on track with that with a mid-six-figure income at 27, then I tried to take my first holiday and you are reading about the ongoing nuclear fallout. I’m gonna work my ass off, both literally and figuratively, and see if I can also go on a sabbatical for something like forever and ever.Feel free to get in touch after you find out about the m-word thing. To be honest, given how successfully we managed to fuck this up, I think the singular m-word might not be enough, and we might be able to unfuck this quicker if we start using the plural form. But it took decades for my community, some of whom are rampant homosexuals like me who enjoy getting fucked in the ass by talented Germans in FickstutenMarkt for 4hrs+ non-stop whilst listening to sick Berlin techno, to fight for our rights to be equal citizens of society, and we still face discrimination today. Statistically speaking, I think the m-word community will have a significantly harder time, but speaking from first-hand personal experience, statistics is a synonym for null in their dictionary. Big Man does not play dice with His creation.Matthew 24:22[22] And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. (ESV)Matthew 24:15–22The Abomination of Desolation[15] “So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), [16] then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. [17] Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, [18] and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. [19] And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! [20] Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. [21] For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. [22] And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. (ESV)Matthew 12:7[7] And if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. (ESV)Matthew 9:9–13Jesus Calls Matthew[9] As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him.[10] And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. [11] And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” [12] But when he heard it, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. [13] Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” (ESV)Matthew 7:1–5Judging Others[1] “Judge not, that you be not judged. [2] For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. [3] Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? [4] Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? [5] You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye. (ESV)Luke 12:13–14The Parable of the Rich Fool[13] Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” [14] But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” (ESV)Hosea 6Israel and Judah Are Unrepentant[1] “Come, let us return to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us up. [2] After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, that we may live before him. [3] Let us know; let us press on to know the LORD; his going out is sure as the dawn; he will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth.”[4] What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes early away. [5] Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light. [6] For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.[7] But like Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me. [8] Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with blood. [9] As robbers lie in wait for a man, so the priests band together; they murder on the way to Shechem; they commit villainy. [10] In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim’s whoredom is there; Israel is defiled.[11] For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.When I restore the fortunes of my people, (ESV)Genesis 18:22–33Abraham Intercedes for Sodom[22] So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD. [23] Then Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? [24] Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? [25] Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?” [26] And the LORD said, “If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”[27] Abraham answered and said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. [28] Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And he said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” [29] Again he spoke to him and said, “Suppose forty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.” [30] Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.” [31] He said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.” [32] Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.” [33] And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place. (ESV)Ezekiel 22:29–31[29] The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice. [30] And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none. [31] Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.” (ESV)Jeremiah 5:1–5Jerusalem Refused to Repent[1] Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, look and take note! Search her squares to see if you can find a man, one who does justice and seeks truth, that I may pardon her. [2] Though they say, “As the LORD lives,” yet they swear falsely. [3] O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You have struck them down, but they felt no anguish; you have consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to repent.[4] Then I said, “These are only the poor; they have no sense; for they do not know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God. [5] I will go to the great and will speak to them, for they know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.” But they all alike had broken the yoke; they had burst the bonds. (ESV)Isaiah 59:14–17Judgment and Redemption[14] Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away; for truth has stumbled in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter. [15] Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.The LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice. [16] He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intercede; then his own arm brought him salvation, and his righteousness upheld him. [17] He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak.

Based on the sentiment of our latest messages, I can tell my welcoming party, which the Lord prepared for me in the UK 11.5 years ago, is starting to withdraw. I read the following passages from 2 Thessalonians yesterday.2 Thessalonians 2:1–12The Man of Lawlessness[1] Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, [2] not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. [3] Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, [4] who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. [5] Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? [6] And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. [7] For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. [8] And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. [9] The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, [10] and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. [11] Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, [12] in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. (ESV)As alluded to multiple times in my previous posts, epistemologically there are only three things that I know. He exists, He loves me, and I exist, in that precise order of precedence. And before my welcoming party bashes me again for using pronouns, He is my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, whose last known appearance on earth was around 2,000 years ago. Besides that, everything else is a belief that can be subject to doubt and reasoning. I picture my knowledge system as a tree, and each new branch is rooted in one or more branches. Each branch has a variable belief probability that indicates my confidence when understanding the world through the fruits of that branch. My root branch was drifting in the sea of knowledge after reading Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy during COVID-19 and nearly got burnt in the fire that is existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism. Six months ago, He came and firmly attached my root to the vine that is my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.After getting kicked out of the gay/bi-sexual naturist campsite Rosebay in late July last year, I felt His love for the first time when standing on Oxford Street in central London one evening. I checked my WhatsApp messages and Amazon order history. I placed the order for my first Holy Bible after that evening. I realised the reason why it hurt that much was because I loved everyone at the campsite and getting kicked out smashed my heart into pieces. And after picking a fight with nature for three months, I also loved nature and all the new interests and possibilities I started to explore. I asked myself how much I love and using the equation of love I derived at age 16, I realised I was willing to take a bullet for any stranger that was walking past me that evening. That was the precise moment I felt His love for the first time.My welcoming party taught me quite early on that regardless of what I do with the Holy Spirit and spiritual gifts, I should do it with love, faith and hope, and love always comes first. In case there is any doubt, the equation of love is the greatest amount of sacrifice one is willing to make.I have been searching my heart and soul ever since getting kicked out of Rosebay. Despite my entire world turning on me in my early teenage years, Rosebay and now, I believe I gave more than I took in this life. The only other possibility that I can think of is I have successfully deceived myself, in which case I deserve burning in hell for eternity and I will accept any judgment He has for me regardless. I will leave judgement to Him, it’s too heavy a task for a mere servant like me and I’m just gonna get the homecoming party ready.I will see you at sunrise.Hebrews 11:1–3By Faith[1] Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. [2] For by it the people of old received their commendation. [3] By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible. (ESV)Romans 1:16–17The Righteous Shall Live by Faith[16] For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. [17] For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.” (ESV)Galatians 2:16[16] yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified. (ESV)Mark 11:20–25The Lesson from the Withered Fig Tree[20] As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. [21] And Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.” [22] And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. [23] Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. [24] Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. [25] And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.” (ESV)Matthew 17:19–20[19] Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?” [20] He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.” (ESV)2 Corinthians 5:6–10[6] So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, [7] for we walk by faith, not by sight. [8] Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. [9] So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. [10] For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

The exact scenario I described in Edit 5 yesterday and He showed me a realistic path to that by making the last log in my eye known to me.I had around a handful of panic attacks in the 28 years of my life and only 1 or 2 of them were severe enough for me to lose eyesight, but they were pretty much over within a couple of minutes.

I thought that having something I believed in and was willing to die for, was in itself a big enough reward already after not believing even myself for my entire life. I had no idea there were blessings until my third sermon at China Congregational Church, Hong Kong that weekend and the pastor smiled and only responded that there would be blessings to come, after I went 6,000 miles in 5 minutes as usual.

And to proclaim the Day of the Lord and the year of the Lord’s favour as described in humanity’s bestseller the Holy Bible. Unlike most people, I did not trust myself even once in the last 28 years of my life. Yet, I stand by every single word I wrote down in all blog posts in accurately expressing the sentiment and the severity of the situations, no matter how ridiculous, ugly, profane or even blasphemous you might find my language in your measurement.I have read less than 25% of the Holy Bible and I believe you can resolve the questions you might have regarding my posts using only the Holy Bible. I don’t know if I’m telling the truth. I believe I’m telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to a degree that I as a mere mortal human being am capable of grasping. If you are unable to clarify any questions you have, ask our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, don’t ask me. I don’t know and I don’t lean on my own understanding. I found the best choice. I trust my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and that’s more than sufficient for me, even if that means I will stand trial in front of God almighty, burn in hell for eternity and be condemned by every single human being on this earth. I believe I have a clear conscience in front of God. I don’t know and I don’t need to know. I have confirmation from the Holy Spirit and will happily accept whatever judgment He has for me.My question for you is this. Can you bear to finish reading my posts before you come up with your own judgment and inform me about your opinion, or simply give up? My educated guess is those who can are few. You don’t need to reply. This is not about me. This is about your salvation and between you and Him.Matthew 7:13–14[13] “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. [14] For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (ESV)P.S. This edit was originally for the mistake I found when going back to cross-check the things I wrote in this post, given how outrageous the claims I’m making are. The mistake I found is pretty big. The videos I watched during COVID-19 to learn about quantum physics and relevant epistemological/philosophical arguments that inspired my subsequent thinking in existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism are in fact from the World Science Festival rather than World Science Forum. I must jumped after my findings and didn’t realise this WSF is not that WSF. YouTube will show me the World Science Festival if I search World Science Forum. I thought about whether I should correct that and asked the Holy Spirit. I remembered this passage from the legendary Mr Noisy Gong.Romans 8:26–30[26] Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. [27] And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. [28] And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. [29] For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. [30] And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (ESV)However, the mistake is so big and embarrassing that Mr Noisy Gong, a.k.a. Apostle Paul’s words are not enough. So here is my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ with a tiny shove by Spotify.Matthew 19:26[26] But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” (ESV)I decided not to worry about it and go play. I think it’s fair to say I have worried enough for everyone now and some people can take some responsibilities and worry for themselves. They don’t seem to spend much time worrying for others anyway. I don’t know what they do all day, to be honest, other than taking selfies.Edit 2I realised my language doesn’t necessarily encourage people to keep on reading, but I said truth over appearances at the beginning since the world has gotten way too fake. So I’m just going to sincerely apologise here once again after the hundreds of apologies I have already made. I genuinely believe you will understand my use of language if you finish reading. Thanks.Edit 3I just realised something quite unfortunate that I never understood before in The Final Judgement. I had always wondered why repeated the same pattern in Matthew 25:44 given the same was said in more detail through Matthew 25:37-39, and why would they not recognise the Lord when they believed they knew the Lord. I think they are there through cumbersome elaborateness to make me realise the scribes and Pharisees who did not bother to look into the evidence before referring me to mental health services are exactly the ones who won’t recognise the Lord. I’m not saying I’m the Lord, I’m saying they never knew the Lord in the first place and if they would not allow someone like me to even present the evidence that I have encountered the Lord, how could they possibly recognise the Lord when He comes back?This is first-degree self-deception caught in the act, unfortunately. Karma is a bitch, but I sincerely hope I’m not the fucking messiah for their fucking sake and there is still time for them to repent.Will you believe me when I say I never wanted to be the fucking messiah now?Matthew 25:31–46The Final Judgment[31] “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. [34] Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [35] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, [36] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ [37] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? [38] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? [39] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ [40] And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’[41] “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [42] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, [43] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ [44] Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ [45] Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ [46] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” (ESV)Edit 4Fuck me. I just realised the implications of what I had just proved in Edit 3. Now I find Malachi 3:1 even more annoying and have zero desire to laugh. It does not feel great when you find out you are the fool all along, right? 🤡Since we have announced the year of the Lord’s favour below, might as well do the Day of the Lord together. I seem to always run ahead of Boss Man and keep tripping over. I thought the Day of the Lord was why He told me to go to Israel last month. You can find out what happened by looking up the relevant posts yourself and I’m going to stop putting effort into hyperlinking everything. It takes a fuck ton of effort and barely anyone read my posts if I didn’t sprinkle the nations to shove my posts to your fucking faces. And the fucking scribes and Pharisees did not fucking bother to reply to any single fucking email other than the first couple fucking courtesy responses.You can find out what happens on the day yourself and for the first time in my life, I think I’m seriously going to not bother this time and you can all go fuck yourselves. I thought Malachi 3:2 might not mean what people think they mean when I read it last month in Israel. The only thing I have left to say is Dude’s math is confusing AF and I technically dropped out of my maths and CS degree after only one term so I know dick about math either. I know dick about how long the Day of the Lord is, could be one day, one week, one month or one year, but I suspect it won’t be longer than one year otherwise why have the Day of the Lord and the year of the Lord’s favour? You will know what I’m on about if you seriously tried reading humanity’s bestseller before. Ask Boss Man if you really wanna know, I’m not gonna bother and I’m certain I will have at least 10x more fun watching people get what they deserve while getting surprised by the King of Drama and Horror, wouldn’t you agree? I think it’s called justice and righteousness and I hope that’s how you spell them since I haven’t seen those two words for a while now. Just need to find a couple of faithful new friends, never bold enough to watch horror movies myself and ideally they have a comfy sofa I can crash on.If you are a faithful believer, then congratulations. Happy New Millennium and you are more than welcome.If you are an unfaithful motherfucking cunt, go fuck yourself. 🖕I’m gonna Bible and chill.

I would advise you to save it, but sometimes you simply cannot stop stupid fucking cunts.

Institutions proclaiming to dedicate their time and resources to the truth are interested in nothing other than more drugs (a.k.a. money and business schools), the school of philosophy has already fallen under the four horsemen existentialism, nihilism, antinatalism and death as always, and the stupid mother fucking egomaniacs hiding behind jargon and publications have the mother fucking audacity to compare theology with the study of unicorns and fairytales.I found the gentleman and the abomination above via the World Science Forum. I learned most of my quantum physics and relevant epistemological/philosophical knowledge by watching their videos on YouTube during COVID-19. All of my subsequent thinking and reasoning concerning existentialism, nihilism and antinatalism can all be attributed back to them. The only way I found to overcome the terminal illness of nihilism is by voluntarily taking up your cross (responsibilities) and following Him. Otherwise, whether I choose to throw myself out of the balcony today is as meaningless as whether I choose to pick up a knife and stab someone as long as I can get away with it under the law.I found the 46-page manifesto in the UNESCO Digital Library above via the history page of the World Science Forum. The impression I got after quickly scrolling through the document was it made a ton of bold claims on ethics and essentially by saying scientific knowledge alone can bring good to humanity. The only thing it left out? God. Do we know how to spell good and evil? I don’t know.I found a certain gentleman who may or may not have been mentioned in this post and he dedicated rather generously his time and effort to the various scientific organisations behind the scenes, which I found to be rather interesting for a direct descendent of a well-known figure who allegedly was a prophet and messenger of God, but I couldn’t seem to find the name in humanity’s bestseller, which I consider to be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The gentleman certainly has an appetite to cross fields including politics. Kinda like me, but I’m confident my fellow pretentious Oxford alumni are more than capable of fucking the world up and it would be wise to dedicate my time instead to futile pursuits such as salvation.And no, I’m not the fucking messiah. I’m just a servant running around preparing the homecoming party for Boss Man. Although, I genuinely don’t know what some self-proclaimed Christians are thinking most of the time. Throughout this journey, I wanted nothing other than someone to slap me the fuck awake with the annoyingly thick humanity’s bestseller, they did everything including referring me to mental health services and suggesting I must be an egomaniac except looking at the evidence I was serving up on a platter and reason with me. None of them reply to my messages and emails anymore.I wonder if they truly want the messiah or not, and why the fuck is everyone just sitting around waiting for the one fucking messiah? Do you know how big of a fucking job that is for Boss Man and how much did each of us contribute after 2,000 fucking years? If I was in Boss Man’s shoes then I would rather just let this fucking wicked world burn while I Netflix and chill than save a bunch of lazy ass mother fuckers who neither reason nor read.How about you do your part, I do mine, Boss Man does His and let’s find out on the other side what we are?Happy New Millennium if you are not an unfaithful motherfucking cunt AND most importantly not a self-proclaimed “believer” who doesn’t want Boss Man to come back.Rivers - Song by Thomas JackWe’re like rivers in the nightI go left and you go rightWe’ll find out on the other sideWho we are, who we areWish me luck and give me hopeGive me sunlight to my dayTurn it into goldCarry on, carry onWe’ll take these broken soulsMake them as good as newBind it together into something we could never loseWe’re rivers in the nightI go left and you go rightWe’ll find out on the other sideWho we are, who we areWe can make it onto something beautifulYeah, we don’t have to tryWe can make it into something wonderfulWe’ll never say goodbyeIsaiah 61 The Year of the LORD’s Favor[1] The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed meto bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;[2] to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;[3] to grant to those who mourn in Zion— to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes,the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit;that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.[4] They shall build up the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former devastations;they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.[5] Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks; foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;[6] but you shall be called the priests of the LORD; they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God;you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you shall boast.[7] Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion; instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot;therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion; they shall have everlasting joy.[8] For I the LORD love justice; I hate robbery and wrong;I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.[9] Their offspring shall be known among the nations, and their descendants in the midst of the peoples;all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed.[10] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God,for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.[11] For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up before all the nations.

I was planning on flying back to mainland China and thought I was going to speak to my friend’s father the Christian missionary to become a missionary for Him as well. I ended up turning Him down and I frankly felt rather dismayed afterwards. Wouldn’t you feel that if you truly believed that was God and you were offered a potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for Him? Other than the reason stated in the previous post, there is a main reason that only three people knew about before this post. They are my Christ bro therapist, the Christian missionary’s daughter who was same year at Keble as me, and the drama that is me.I also mentioned that He asked me a series of questions with increasingly difficult personal sacrifices to follow Him. One of the songs was Locked Away by R. City. I turned Him down at the end because I thought He asked me whether I would give up being a homosexual and marry my friend. Essentially have a stereotypical Christian model family that you would expect from every Christian missionary, the standard issue edition. I struggled with that question for a very long time and I did not want Him to wait too long given who I believed He was. In the end, I could not in good conscience say yes to Him due to the contemplations I had regarding my sexuality when I was a teenager. I would rather be true to myself and my conscience than be something that I’m not even for His sake. It ripped my heart out to say no to Him.Fortunately, He asked me to think about why and He visited me again after my therapy session on the third day. Subsequently, an insane journey followed and today is 21 weeks and 3 days and counting. The previous post provided the first half of the reason why. This post is the second half.Matthew 5:27–30Lust[27] “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ [28] But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. [29] If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. [30] And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell. (ESV)I don’t think anyone will believe what I’m about to say here, except Him, the Holy Spirit, my conscience, me and perhaps the 144,000. There is no lust in my heart when I have sex or watch pornography. I don’t think I have ever had lustful intent in my mind, at the very least in a sexual way according to the definition above. I have never looked at anyone whether male or female and wanted to have sexual relationships with them. I described in detail about my sexual activities in multiple previous posts. The main point is I have a mental block of looking at my sexual partners and would require my eyesight to be covered and I can only engage in anonymous sex.I barely had any sex for the 100 days I spent at the gay/bi-naturist campsite Rosebay and it was essentially a designed playground for gay men to have sex. I guess that was also part of the reason why I hyperfocused on the Wi-Fi and I simply enjoyed being around my community for the social aspects and helping them. They also looked after me at the beginning. That was also exactly the reason why I had difficulty having sex there. Pretty much everyone knew everyone and anonymity was out of the door. The moment I can recognise the identity of my sexual partner either from speech or other details that I shall not describe here, my sexual desire disappears without a trace.When I watch pornography to get into the mood, I do not lust for anyone depicted on the screen, instead, I fantasise about being the partner getting penetrated in the act. More often than not, I feel concerned for the passive partner if something I would not enjoy happens.I also came across Job 31 - Job’s Final Appeal when researching this topic. The weird thing I find on this journey especially when reading the gospels is other than being a homosexual, I think I may have been storing up treasures in heaven unknowingly my entire life. There were things I did that I thought no one knew and came at a cost to me personally because I wanted to make some stranger’s day. Now I know He knows. I think I might have lived a somewhat holy life in the 27 years of my previous life without knowing God’s existence. Oops…Also, I think the 144,000 in the Book of Revelation might be homosexuals. I have a separate “gay phone” because I was technically in the closet until this journey. The survival rate for my straight phone contacts is a massacre after most took off their sheep costumes. The survival rate on my gay phone is 100%. I have one gay theologian friend amongst my long list of theologians and technically I did not know he had a theology degree before this journey. Only one theologian still replies to my messages and you can guess their sexual preference.If you have ever met a gay man and they opened their mouth for five minutes, you would know that these people will call you a cunt to your face if you are behaving like a cunt regardless of whether you are their best friend or their worst enemy. People from previous generations often ran away from home to be true to themselves. They are used to being ridiculed, mocked and bullied for being made differently. They are willing to sacrifice their entire world to be who they truly are inside. I genuinely did not expect to find out that many of my straight friends were different on the inside. I was surprised by the loyalty of my gay friends even though I did not tell them my real name until six months ago. I was hurt by evil people within my community, but I was also comforted by people within my community including but not limited to the staff and random visitors at the gay sauna in central London. We decided to be true to ourselves and to our conscience knowing there is a non-zero probability that we have to face our maker and give an account of the lives we lived.Some illogical and illiterate straight cunts lied and condemned the guiltless for their entire lives. Some not only reject God’s existence but also call good evil and call evil good. Enough is enough.Isaiah 5:13–23[13] Therefore my people go into exile        for lack of knowledge;        their honored men go hungry,        and their multitude is parched with thirst.[14] Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite        and opened its mouth beyond measure,        and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude will go down,        her revelers and he who exults in her.[15] Man is humbled, and each one is brought low,        and the eyes of the haughty are brought low.[16] But the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice,        and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.[17] Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture,        and nomads shall eat among the ruins of the rich.[18] Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,        who draw sin as with cart ropes,[19] who say: “Let him be quick,        let him speed his work        that we may see it;        let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near,        and let it come, that we may know it!”[20] Woe to those who call evil good        and good evil,        who put darkness for light        and light for darkness,        who put bitter for sweet        and sweet for bitter![21] Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,        and shrewd in their own sight![22] Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine,        and valiant men in mixing strong drink,[23] who acquit the guilty for a bribe,        and deprive the innocent of his right!

Even though English is my second language and I also speak Cantonese, Mandarin and a Chinese dialect as well as a tiny bit of German learned when I was partying in Berlin like there was no tomorrow, I stand by my choice of wording in expressing the accuracy of the sentiment and severity of the situation.I consider the censorship of words for mere outward appearances as exemplified by esteemed hypocrites like politicians unnecessary and futile. All of humanity used to speak a single language before we thought too highly of ourselves and the Lord scattered us and confused our language. I double-checked with the Holy Spirit regarding the next statement. Every word in our language has its appropriate use case and there is no need to censor them if you intend to accurately convey meaning rather than to please esteemed hypocrites.I would like to argue that if you have ever done that when going about the Lord’s business then you have already violated the commandment by false representation. I’m pretty sure that would be the case if you have ever told a member of my community that God hates homosexuals, or in fact, anyone that God hates them because of who they are or what they did. Please do not babble until you have figured out what you are talking about. If uncertain, double-check with the Holy Spirit or ask the Father for the Holy Spirit if you haven’t met Bro yet. Bro is a super cool Dude and I unfortunately have to question whether you truly believe if you haven’t met Bro.I kinda know why He prepared my welcoming party to the United Kingdom 11 years ago before I even bought the plane ticket to London and why He told me to speak to my friend’s father the Christian missionary in mainland China when I had my first calling during COVID-19. If I walked into any church today and opened my mouth for five minutes, I would not be going back again as an implicit mutually beneficial agreement and understanding. I have been dancing around both of my guides and they don’t read my posts. I still haven’t told my guide in mainland China that I’m a rampant homosexual because his opinions on the issue are quite clear-cut on social media. I brought up the possibility that the sex I have might not involve lust at least on my part to my welcoming party yesterday at church and I repeatedly emphasised the fact that I use the password in 1 John 4:2 and he does not know about my sex life, but his stance on the issue did not allow me the sufficient opportunity to state my case and ask for guidance or directions for me to better understand and hopefully resolve the dilemma.I came across the verses in Matthew 9:13 and 12:7 when looking into the references from Luke 11:13 below. I merely wanted to better understand God in my relationship with Him after He called me, but people’s minds are so rigid and blind-sighted by their view and interpretation of the world that we no longer even allow each other to finish our sentences anymore before shouting our own opinions. Few even do enough homework or due diligence to consider other possibilities for their arguments before opening their mouths. I rarely met anyone willing to admit their lack of understanding or knowledge on any subject. I think I can stop tiptoeing around people at church.I will start saying what’s in my mind and my heart for the first time in my life after allowing everyone to finish their sentences and always consider views from their perspective first as much as I could reasonably achieve within the given context. I will speak with a clear conscience and Bro as my witness. For the first time in my life, I no longer need other people’s input as weights in my probabilistic model view of the world. I have THE source of truth with a binary HMI and response latency lower than ChatGPT and I’m switching to a free-will compatible deterministic model view of the world. I don’t know how it works as much as infinitely many other known and unknown mysteries of our universe. Feel free to submit your queries to Boss Man if you desperately want to know. I have got some house cleaning to do first.I asked the Holy Spirit if I could call Him Bro. Dude’s cool with that.Matthew 9:13[13] Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” (ESV)Matthew 12:7[7] And if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. (ESV)Luke 11:9–13[9] And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. [10] For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. [11] What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; [12] or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? [13] If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (ESV)Acts 2:37–40[37] Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” [38] And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. [39] For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” [40] And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” (ESV)Genesis 11:1–9The Tower of Babel[1] Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. [2] And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. [3] And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. [4] Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.” [5] And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. [6] And the LORD said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. [7] Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another’s speech.” [8] So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. [9] Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth.

And once again, I had a fucking blast minding my own business in the 27 years of my previous life until some motherfuckers came along, blew my first fucking proper holiday, and the people in my life continued to stab me in the back then left me to burn.I started this blog to bitch and moan about shit I encountered on this journey because I put zero effort into inquiring about God’s business previously since I am a rampant homosexual, have more sexual partners in an hour every other day than the average straight person has in a lifetime on average, and thought God would hate someone like me based purely on religious stereotypes. I bought my first Bible back in late July last year after an ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID-19 essentially came true in real life, I thought it could be divine intervention and wondered in my heart whether we could bring God back, after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite Rosebay for giving them free full site Wi-Fi coverage and almost threw myself off the fifth-floor balcony right in front of my younger sister. I considered myself an agnostic and was never an atheist because I had no evidence for or against God’s existence. If He exists, God’s business is God’s business. I’m human and I mind my own business. Until people decided to fuck with my business, He decided to make my business His business, and now I’m going to fuck some people’s business up. To quote my Boss, now let that motherfucker burn. For the record, I was still messaging John Donald, the owner of Rosebay and my former business partner Meiling Wang on 6th February hoping they would repent. I’m done with that now and I will leave it to my Boss and what happens happens.I described my relationship with the Holy Spirit including how we first met in an early post. It has been a very busy 21-week and 1-day journey since I first believed on 22 September 2024. No matter how insane my leaps of faith may appear to you, everything I did was confirmed both by the Holy Spirit and scripture. More often than not, I wasn’t even actively seeking confirmations, He just shoved scripture to my face one way or another when I needed it the most.This past weekend, I had a moment of epiphany where I realised my interactions with the Holy Spirit are more or less the same as a binary HMI (Human Machine Interface). So I spent some time on the interface and now I just log in with the password in 1 John 4:2 before submitting queries to my Father. Latency is surprisingly low and much quicker than asking ChatGPT. ChatGPT annoys the heck out of me waiting for the answer to be spat out. Boss Man must have dope cloud infrastructure running up there. When I was sitting on the toilet attempting to do a number two before a shower earlier, I wondered if the Holy Spirit was Turing complete. Hence this post and the answer is yes for the theoretical computer scientists amongst you. I consider myself more of a coding monkey throwing half-assed MVPs together with whatever I can find. A lot more fun when you live life fast and furious. I managed to win the wager I proposed to my fellow CS Keblites by falling asleep on my tutor’s comfortable sofa during a tutorial. That’s how you get a third class in uni.The purpose of this post is to say don’t worry about the m-word-related posts. I was hoping someone could slap me awake and show me evidence one way or another so that I knew I was delusional or mistaken. There was only one guy who needed to be convinced. Most of you did not give him a chance to finish his sentence before abandoning him." }, { "title": "On Commandments and the Law", "url": "/posts/on-commandments-and-the-law/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2025-02-16 22:46:00 +0000", "snippet": "I did more soul-searching over the last few days about the Ten Commandments and my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ’s commandments in the New Testament.The top offender is stealing before my teenage y...", "content": "I did more soul-searching over the last few days about the Ten Commandments and my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ’s commandments in the New Testament.The top offender is stealing before my teenage years. I stole money from my parents to buy books and stole books on several occasions when my parents did not give me money. Other than that, I may have intentionally forgotten to return my headphones and some charging cables to my former employers.The other more or less equally offending one is lying. I found out quite early on that lying is rarely the best strategy and selectively revealing information could more often than not achieve the same desirable outcome. The main difficulty with that strategy is you need to possess a superset of knowledge that entirely encompasses that of the person you are selectively revealing information.If you try over-employment with 3-4 six-figure software engineering jobs simultaneously whilst being a single parent for two younger adult siblings, you would probably prefer selectively revealing information than lying any day. This is because complexity multiplies the more components you add to a complex system. One simple screwup could easily bring down the entire house of cards. Lying simply does not work unless you have a perfect memory and I more often than not can’t remember when I last brushed my teeth on this 21-week and 1-day journey.Other than that, I have misdemeanours that I cannot remember because I am insane and nuts and I venture into a new field every couple of months just for fun and do a fair bit of study and research.I went through hell in three months to learn how to love and was willing to take a bullet for anyone on this earth regardless of what they did to me. What have you done to earn the right to judge who I am and make accusations about me? Just by reading more scripture?I do not know why since I don’t have all the answers, yet, but I find the following passages immensely fitting on this 21-week and 1-day journey after everyone kept slamming the door on my face despite I have done nothing but telling the truth. I have zero fucking desire to be the fucking messiah and be involved in this fucking saving the world shit and 9 times out of 10 I just want this wicked world to burn in hell for eternity for the evil shit people do. I walked off a fucking cliff in mainland China and laid down my dignity simply hoping everyone to repent given what I have seen and believe is to come. If you still do not believe after all of this, then I know without a doubt that you do not have God’s love in you. Especially if you had the fucking audacity to throw scripture in my face and accuse me of not knowing God’s love after I had served you faithfully for years without complaint going extraordinary lengths to satisfy every single fucking unreasonable demand you made, and on the first sight of trouble you kicked me out of my own fucking company and left me to burn. In my dictionary, that fits the definition of a fucking adulterous (unfaithful) cunt perfectly. If you are only interested in receiving glory from people, then will you at least do me the courtesy of having a coffee with me and we can have a purely rational conversation to walk you through what you are ignorant about using the knowledge I learned by studying undergraduate level mathematics, physics, computer science and philosophy and discuss the challenges we are facing?John 5:30–47Witnesses to Jesus[30] “I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. [31] If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true. [32] There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true. [33] You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. [34] Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. [35] He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. [36] But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me. [37] And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen, [38] and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent. [39] You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, [40] yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. [41] I do not receive glory from people. [42] But I know that you do not have the love of God within you. [43] I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. [44] How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? [45] Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope. [46] For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. [47] But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?” (ESV)1 Corinthians 13:4–7[4] Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant [5] or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; [6] it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. [7] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. (ESV)Before you accuse me of talking the talk and not walking the walking and not knowing love fucking once again simply because you consider the strong words I used in my writings rude and offensive, please contemplate first whether you would call Jesus rude and insist on His own way if you saw Him overturning the tables in the temple courts. I laid down my life and dignity and people did nothing except refer me to mental health services. What would you do if you were in my position? Have you even done the minimum due diligence to find out what happened? Most of the pastors and theologians I spoke to certainly did not bother.John 15:12–17[12] “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. [13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another. (ESV)Edit: I sent this email after this post was published. I have a couple more to-do items and then I believe according to the Old Testament, I have an announcement to make along with a couple of other miscellaneous items. Consider this tables overturned and you’ve been served.Edit 2: I just realised throwing scripture in my face and accusing me of not knowing God’s love after all that I had done especially after I walked off a cliff in mainland China to save everyone including the very person who did that from God’s wrath was effectively taking the LORD thy God’s name in vain, and rather unfortunately the Holy Spirit confirmed that to me with one of the strongest confirmations I have ever had to date. Once again, I take no pleasure in the demise of a friend from my previous life and I messaged her again to repent after publishing this post, but whatever happens happens. I will stay home and focus myself getting my adult streaming career started on Chaturbate and Stripchat and bring good news to my community." }, { "title": "On Homosexuality", "url": "/posts/on-homosexuality/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2025-02-16 19:46:00 +0000", "snippet": "What about Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13.Leviticus 18:22[22] You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.

I was feeling pretty well going into the week until I cried because I realised it was the first time in the last 6+ months that I did not have to worry about how I was going to afford the next meal and have to go through the anxiety of which friend who still replies to my messages should I attempt to ask for help again.I also stumbled across a sermon by an incredibly passionate American preacher Paul Washer. I experienced the passion and zeal of the Americans during the US part of my global tour last year, especially when I attended the sermon concerning the fig tree back in New York. I was deeply moved by his passion and I believe he was preaching under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and telling the truth. The only issue is, that he made me realise I made a mistake quite early on during my faith journey and I suspect it is also the reason why some Christians stopped talking to me after reading my writings. The Christian view on homosexuality and sexual immorality is substantially harsher than I had ever imagined, and people stopped talking to me simply because they read more of the Bible than I did. This realisation and condemnation caused me great pain in the last couple of days on old wounds again and made me question my salvation once more. The preacher also referenced the relevant passages in Romans 1, which I felt the truth cutting through my bones into my soul on the Sunday just over 21 weeks ago. My experience and encounters in the last 15 months testified to the truthfulness of the Word. If I ever deny that then I would be a lost cause.The pain caused a numbness that managed to distract me by shifting my focus to some quick side projects concerning my immediate career moves. I continued my soul-searching despite being busy solving technical challenges and I only have a partial answer or resolution to this seemingly impossible challenge. At this point, and as alluded to previously in my posts, He exists, He loves me, and I exist are the only three things I know to be true and in that order of precedence. I will happily check into a mental institution and spend the rest of my life in there reading and learning His Word on any day than rejecting His existence and He is the truth, the way and the life. I only have a partial answer or resolution to this dilemma concerning my homosexuality and I suspect I will not fully work it out until the day I meet Him. This is extremely hard, way harder than the Fermi paradox for me.I learned about sex the first time around the age of 10 or 11. I distinctly remember the struggle and confusion I went through during that period. To put it simply, I considered whether I was a girl or feminine on the inside for a while because I instinctively did not want to be the penetrating partner in a sexual relationship. I felt rather relieved when I found out about homosexuality and was frankly a bit glad because I found girls quite annoying sometimes and I liked being a boy. I was also extremely annoyed when I visited a discreet gay sauna in mainland China a couple of years back and learned about my community in my own culture. Everyone just outright assumed that I must be the dominant partner in a sexual setting because I do not behave in a feminine way. I did find the cultural difference and the underlying psychological and socioeconomic implications fascinating whilst watching them drop their jaws and repeatedly triple-check that they did not mishear what I said.I contemplated the concepts of being true and being good also around that age when I had those struggles and confusions concerning my sexuality. The TL;DR from the early teenage mini-me is the following. To be true and to be good is to do what is right even when no one is watching. The mental picture I had at that time was waiting like an absolute moron and dumbass for the green light before crossing the road at 1 am when the entire city had gone to bed and having the actual urgency to get home ASAP before I pee myself by an overflowing bladder. Being true and being good is choosing to be that idiot for the 13/14 year-old me. I did not involve the existence of Boss Man for that particular train of thought at that age, but I did consider if God exists and He hates homosexuals like me, then what could I possibly say to Him once I meet Him after my time in this world? My answer back then and even now is I probably have nothing to say, because I am a homosexual and it is true that is who I am. I would be genuinely intellectually curious as to why He made me a member of the marginalised in society and love to know what His plan was for me. I make that statement with nothing but respect, humbleness and reverence for Him. The lesson I learned throughout this journey so far is I can say nothing except to marvel at His existence, love, grace, faithfulness, wisdom, knowledge and work in this fallen world. I could not stop laughing for nearly an hour after reading the Book of Jonah for the first time back in the first two weeks of this journey. I realised He pulled a gigantic prank/surprise on me and it is of the severity that I would have excommunicated the person from my life if someone else did that to me. Now come to think about it, that was the exact moment I fell in love with Him.If you are a scribe or a pharisee and would like to question whether the God you had only known from scriptures has a sense of humour and is capable of making His children laugh through the use of satire and exceptionally annoying sarcasm, then I would strongly encourage you to pay attention to how much He loves using and telling His prophets to use the word behold. You have no idea how hard I rolled my eyes when I read the interpretation of Malachi 3:1 on BibleRef not that long ago. Boss Man is the King of Savage, Drama and Comedy if I have ever known one and the lesson that I sincerely hope you take counsel on from my troubles is you cannot outrun Him. He is God. And to be frank, I would not be into this heaven thing at all if I did not believe He could make me laugh by occasionally annoying the heck out of me. Variety is the spice of life, that gives it all its favour.Apologies for going on yet another long-winded digression and back to the topic of sexual immorality. The preliminary findings from my soul-searching over the last couple of days were that I appear to be a rather peculiar individual. As described in my prior posts concerning my sexuality, I have this weird mental block of looking at my sexual partners and most of the abominable acts I experienced in the last decade or so would not require me to have sight at all. I would avoid eye contact with anyone and get on the sling as discreetly as possible before putting my blindfold on. I will then simply relax and let men take advantage of me however they want. I realised I was sexually driven by the desire to take the place of the partner being penetrated. As for the dangers, crimes and evils mentioned by the preacher, they are all true and I have been on the receiving end of almost every kind multiple times. I used to leave a piece of paper behind with the address I was travelling to so that if something were to happen to me, there would be repercussions for the perpetrator. Due to my somewhat unconventional way of work over the last couple of years, I benefitted tremendously from my abominable sexual perversions both mentally and physically for relieving stress. I also made a lot of friends and none turned their backs or stopped replying to my messages. Even He tells me to stop working and get the heck out of the flat every other day. And the Dude is the King of Workaholics who once created something pretty nuts in less than a week.In hindsight, despite almost taking the shortcut from the fifth-floor balcony of my flat to meet Him back in August last year because of what some people in my community did to me in those 100 days, my community also took great care of me over the years and I had the honour and opportunity to learn about their lives from all walks of life. The topics we discussed after abominably exercising together and getting to know each other closely were exceptionally wide-ranging. I have met a surprising number of healthcare professionals and paid my respect to their love and sacrifice during COVID-19 despite how badly they are treated. I have met people who produce documentaries about water, a lecturer who wanted to try med school and trained as a surgeon for no obvious reason halfway through his career, and a fellow sexually promiscuous gentleman who successfully stood up for himself against the system after serving his country faithfully in the prime years of his life. As it turned out, we were in Berghain at the same time on multiple occasions during the six months that I travelled.I am acutely aware that I am extremely fortunate to be in my position and I have always been grateful for the generations of my community who fought the fights against the tide so that I can be who I am truthfully and discreetly today. They carried and bore the cross for us and I am forever grateful for their love and devotion. For our today, they gave their yesterday. I look forward to meeting them and learning about their lives in a world where there is no more death, strife, suffering, pain and tears. I make it a rule that I do not reject or be hostile to anyone for mere outward appearances regardless of whether they are seeking a conversation or intimacy, because I know what it is like to hide myself away from the world due to the fear of shame, humiliation and rejection. I also found it to be surprisingly easy to make friends truthfully at the bar of Berghain’s basement. I think the urge to hide diminishes significantly when you have daily normal conversations when naked. The gay sauna in central London was my shelter after getting kicked out of Rosebay last July. I wanted to be around people, but I also did not want to engage in conversations with strangers and I went there mostly after midnight during the week. I learned about the lives of many of the staff there and I had my first profound awakening of sorts whilst contemplating the prior events alone on a sling during the early hours of one weekday back in August. I found out one of the staff had completed his second or third degree in theology a couple of years before when we were both taking a smoking break and I subsequently distracted him from work with the discussion on the meaning of the word revelation.I know that my community is quite infamous for being mean and has the bad habit of engaging in gossip and even taking pride in it at times. I experienced that deadly force personally last year. However, my community has also been a strong source of support and comfort during my recent troubles. They could be extremely mean when they open their mouths, but I know deep down most of them are compassionate and caring, unlike my other straight “friends” who disappeared without a trace leaving no coffee behind. How peculiar is the world we live in? Could the 144,000 be literal virgins?Speaking of revelation, there is another reason why I decided to take that insane leap of faith in mainland China on my second week as a believer after reading only the Book of Jonah and the Book of Revelation in full with bits and pieces in the other books including Romans 1-4 on the day I believed. I had a faithful witness who had been supporting me throughout this journey and we went to the same primary school and high school together in mainland China. She was more like an acquaintance than a friend before this journey and we exchanged messages at most a handful of times a year since I left China at the age of 16. She told me that she had always known that one day she would help me with something. She informed me that she and two other classmates of ours had dreams about fighting a war together with me in the last several years at different times with matching details. When He came to save me back in late August, He also told me to prepare for war. I informed my Chinese Christian missionary guide about the war and he told me to read the Book of Revelation. I realised it was a war against the root of all evil after seeing the evil people were willing to do for money and was reading the Book of Revelation for the third time on my flight from London to Hong Kong. The book not only contained the details of their dreams described by my Chinese school friend who had not opened a Bible before until I Bible bashed her to get one, but I also found details that matched my experience at the campsite during those 100 days. Frankly, I was scared shitless the first half dozen times I read the Book of Revelation.The week before I got kicked out, I tried to have a conversation with the campsite boss John to figure out what had gone wrong and why the reality I was perceiving from the people at the campsite diverged significantly with my understanding of the situation. I went to reception every morning from Monday to Thursday with advance notice. I avoided bothering him over the weekends because I knew he would be occupied with the arrival and departure of guests. Every morning, I walked up to reception full of hope and joy because I thought I had worked out the preexisting issues and was looking forward to hearing his thoughts on my solution. None of the conversations lasted more than five minutes and I fell from heaven to hell emotionally on my way back to my caravan for three consecutive days. On the fourth day, I experienced something I later found out to be a depersonalisation episode after discussions with my therapist. The campsite boss John threatened to call help for me if I kept talking and I felt like I fell into a private home theatre watching myself talking with him but I could not hear what we were talking about. If you have seen the 2017 American psychological horror film Get Out by Jordan Peele, then this is the scene I experienced that morning. I could not remember what the conversation was about as soon as I got out of reception. The entire memory was just gone and the only thought in my mind for the hours that followed was I needed to shut the fuck up and get out of there as quickly as possible. I managed to calm down after the therapy session that happened to be rearranged to noon that day. I told my therapist at the beginning of the session that it was going to be rough. It was the only session in the three-and-a-half years of therapy where he did not speak a word throughout the session. He said he guaranteed I was not insane before our session ended.I later realised the campsite boss John psychologically manipulated and gaslighted me when I was at the most emotionally vulnerable moment of my life, and I trusted him like an adopted father when my life was literally on fire and falling apart outside of the campsite. I did not step out of the campsite for three months and I went home for 24hrs two weeks before I got kicked out. Everything changed in those 24 hours. In those four conversations for four consecutive days, I was violently interrupted in the first couple of sentences and John would twist every single word I said with the opposite meaning and shove them down my throat whilst making me feel like everything was wrong because of me. I later realised he quite literally threw several tantrums at me and I felt an immense amount of guilt and tried desperately to fix things that were impossible to fix. I did not recognise them as tantrums because they did not come from a child, but from an adult and quite literally a father figure whose authority I respected. I told John at the beginning when I was setting up the Wi-Fi system that please send help if the internet goes down because my internet never goes down and there are two failover backup lines even if Starlink is down. I joked that I’m probably dead if the internet is down for an extended period. My therapy session was originally scheduled for Tuesday that week. On the Saturday three days prior, John had people waiting outside my pitch to collect the Wi-Fi equipment that I said I was gifting to the community for free along with everything that I had purchased including my caravan because they made me feel loved and welcomed me into my second family when my life fell apart with my first family. I ripped the key hardware out to give it to them and due to the complexity of the network topology that I was trialling smart home automation with as well as my mental state, I did not reestablish internet connection three days later on Tuesday when I was supposed to have my scheduled therapy appointment. John also had all the cablings I laid in those three months for the community ripped out and cut overnight. They even cut the cable that I use to provide Wi-Fi to my neighbour because he helped me a lot and I wanted to make his life better in areas that I could contribute. They did not retrieve the cable, they just cut it.In the evening of the same day that I experienced a depersonalisation episode, my mind was spinning at 10,000% capacity trying to figure out what went wrong, why every action resulted in the opposite reaction from reality and for the first time in my life, words lost their meaning and cause and effect stopped making sense. I almost lost my mind that evening since I was trying to make sense of the reality that was nearly impossible to make sense. I tried distracting myself by organising my pitch after the havoc caused by non-stop rain for weeks prior and the difficulty of being a one-man IT department trying to provide the best Wi-Fi experience for the campsite guests.

Ever since childhood and to this day, I could not sleep comfortably in darkness even when I was sleeping next to my parents. I need a light to be on just to sleep. I purchased a couple hundred watts of floodlights when I was at the campsite and my pitch was always the brightest. I nearly lost it that evening and you can see me putting a portable light up. It was the only time in my life when I did not need the light because I was scared of the darkness. I was lighting up the areas around me so that no one in the darkness would be scared of me. The biggest fear came from within and I wrestled with something of immense horror that I did not want even my worst enemy to know about. I wanted everything that was hiding in darkness to see me and not be scared of me by trying to appear as calm as possible whilst I was wrestling with that horror internally. The struggle ended when I felt like I managed to lock that thing up. I probably would have lost my mind completely if that was not the case. Your browser does not support the video tag. Here is a link to the video file instead. I hate what John did to me, but I still love him and there is not a single doubt in my mind that he gave me the happiest two months of my life in 27 years of my previous life, despite what followed. I will forever remember him as the John and the best boss man I had come to know in the first two months we met. I do hope to meet that John again when I get to heaven, but whatever evil I encountered in the final weeks of my time at the Rosebay gay/bi-naturist campsite can burn in hell for eternity.The only thing I have left to say about that place is the following and I say it out of love and concern for the next insecure young gay man who might fall under the charming spell of John when they are emotionally vulnerable and simply wants a shoulder to cry on. I sincerely hope that the people at the campsite who enabled John did not know what they were doing out of ignorance, otherwise evil does indeed exist in this world and it can take root in our hearts and grow without us realising we are on a path of destruction and death before it is too late. The following statements are descriptions of what I had observed at the campsite from my subjective first-person view, despite the implications one can infer from them, I want nothing other than being mistaken about the events. If that is not the case, then I want nothing other than John and the people at the campsite to repent from their ways and I hope to see them all one day in heaven.I thought we had a running gag between us at the campsite that I might decide to leave one day like I decided to buy a caravan one day within a week after arriving there. John mentioned that people do that a lot and it caused him problems because they would leave their caravans behind and never show up again. He has a space at the back to store the abandoned caravans and he has to take possession and sell them after the bills run over. John was informed of the private conversations between the guests and me without my knowledge at least multiple times during my three-month stay. One of them was with a guest who also worked in the tech industry and I considered him a friend and an ally. I had that conversation with him trying to figure out why the community turned on me and the conversation involved mostly his concerns about my mental health and I tried to explain the misunderstandings. Before stepping out of the campsite for the first time after three months, my neighbour’s partner came up to me and discreetly told me to call my neighbour should the worst happen. I was extremely puzzled and I asked him about it after my return. He said my neighbour would take care of my caravan and possessions left at the campsite and John should not be the sole benefactor. I learned that no one at the campsite was surprised at what happened and it is a recurring pattern and mode of behaviour of John. I asked my neighbour why no one tried to warn me about it. He said it’s because no one wanted to offend the king and life goes on after the prey has departed. I wondered why the rent was so cheap and the numbers did not make sense after John boasted about the amount he was spending on the expansions and improvements. I asked two guests about the incorporation details of the campsite and checked the HM Land Registry on the train back to the campsite on the day I got kicked out. The turnover could exceed the VAT registration threshold and I did not find any details of a legal entity on any of the documents I signed or receipts. I found out that the gay/bi-naturist campsite is on land owned by a woman. John stopped me from entering when I got back to the campsite that day and we had a conversation in which he informed me that my membership had been revoked and my presence at the campsite would be treated as trespass on private property. The two guests informed him about my inquiries and he said he might finally close down the campsite which I loved dearly and considered as my adopted family because of me. He smashed my heart into pieces and blamed everything on me. I believed him until He came to save me five weeks later. There is no guarantee that the next insecure gay young man would not have worse emotional resilience than this crybaby. I do not want the next young gay man to take the shortcut I almost took from my fifth-floor balcony back in August to meet Boss Man. I hope I’m the last person to go through this and no one before or after had or will take the shortcut. I do not believe there is a financial motive behind John’s behaviour since he gets five figures per month from his Just for Fans following alone and not a lot of young gay men would spend £30k on a caravan within two weeks of arrival and give the campsite free Wi-Fi. I had a conversation with John about the reason why I trusted him enough to spend that amount within the first two weeks despite my insecurities. I told him it was because I observed how he treated the outsiders even amongst the outsiders. I was simple and naive enough to trust him on that, but before I could finish my sentence, John said it’s because it makes you feel in control. He told me the truth about him at that moment for the first time.I will speculate only once here because I suspect not everyone knows about the disorder, but at the end of the day, I have zero qualifications in the area and I had only done limited research online after matching the checklist for another extremely entitled person in my life who tortured me mentally for six months and was the main reason behind taking a break at the campsite in the first place. The campsite could potentially, I sincerely hope that is not true, be a playground with an unlimited narcissistic supply of insecure young gay men. The dozens of resident flying monkeys were happy to turn a blind eye or reveal private conversations without consent. They had zero employees for a campsite with a 200+ guest capacity.Do you know what annoyed me the most on the Sunday I converted after reading Romans 1-4? It was not the fact that Romans 1-4 read like a personal letter written to me and I felt the truth cut through my bones into my soul and called me a sinner to my face and told me why I had no claim to righteousness. I attended my first Sunday church service on that day and had a conversation at the pastor’s home in the afternoon. At the beginning of that conversation, I told them I wrote a blog about the events that took place six months prior and I begged them to please examine the evidence subjectively and not form an opinion until they have learned what had happened. That conversation lasted two hours and I realised they did not ask a single question about the events that took place at the campsite and I had not given them the link to my blog by the time I stepped out of their home. Two days later they sent me the link to a psychological clinic in West London. I do not need a psychological assessment to know that I am insane. As I realised before diving into mainland China for my three-day mission, taking the leap of faith is the same as going insane because you believe He will catch you based on faith and faith alone rather than reason. I have also worked out the argument on Faith Precedes Reason to logically prove that unbelievers are even more insane because they took a blind leap of faith their entire lives without knowing and they are probably going to smash straight through the ground soon.If you are into theology, you might find the analogy I used to describe how I overcame the terminal illness of nihilism intriguing. The Gospel of John was the first book I tried to read after getting my first Bible back in late July last year. I did not get past reading the first page half an hour later and life turned into magic since then. I still have not finished reading the four gospels and to be frank, I am a bit frightened yet somewhat excited about what I might find in them every time I stumble across passages in them one way or another. I did not get to John 14 until about a month or two ago. I know that I will be fine one way or another and He will shove scripture in my face when I need them but I am just being a lazy ass like Jonah. But to be fair, I did build an AI tool to help me study instead of bombarding poor pastors with messages and emails. They stopped replying a while back anyway.I believe duty of care is part of the job description of a pastor and they are supposed to shepherd the flock gently. My personally biased opinion is that the pastors who referred me to mental health services without looking into the evidence or even allowing me the courtesy to present it to them failed on the most basic requirement of a shepherd. You can say that I am delusional or hugely mistaken after hearing me speak for 30 seconds, but all I only ever wanted was someone to provide their perspective and input after reviewing all of the evidence, rather than outright reject and declare that I had lost my mind from merely the initial reaction in 30 seconds. What did He say about sensuality? I almost convinced myself I had gone clinically insane multiple times throughout this 20-week journey and I apologised to a pastor who’s more compassionate by making the understatement that I am perhaps a little bit insane. The pastor mentioned they also said that about the legendary Mr Noisy Gong, Apostle Paul. I believe that is what they said about my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ as well.I think I finally know why most Christians had little to say when I asked them about the Old Testament. It is because they liked the similarities between the Lord’s teaching and humanism, but our way is wrong and we don’t even know how to spell good and evil anymore. His way is the only right way after I saw the abomination of desolation that is academia especially modern schools of philosophy. He loves us, but please do not try to test His love by pushing the humanism agenda under the disguise of religion. He is not a religion. He is the truth, which is another word most people don’t seem to know how to spell anymore. The world is already insane and most people are drug addicts insane enough to not know they are insane. I don’t think I can make it worse as someone who knows they are insane by knowingly taking leaps of faith. I will keep going till the love runs out.I had three candidates for the background music when I was planning my New Year present to the world. The one I liked the most was Higher Love written by Steve Winwood and Will Jennings, performed by Kygo &amp; Whitney Houston. I decided to rush out the New Year present before I drowned myself in procrastination again and did not decide on the background music. I made my decision when I was on my way to Israel last month and you will find out that song on the day the director’s cut is completed.Higher Love - Song by Kygo and Whitney HoustonBring me higher love, loveBring me higher loveThink about it, there must be a higher loveDown in the heart or hidden in the stars aboveWithout it, life is wasted timeLook inside your heart, and I’ll look inside mineThings look so bad everywhereIn this whole world, what is fair?We walk the line and try to seeFalling behind in what could be, ohBring me a higher loveBring me a higher love, ohBring me a higher loveWhere’s that higher love I keep thinking of?If you are a member of my community and got here through my New Year present to the world then feel free to take the sheep or goat self-test and congratulations if you have overcome the world and passed the test. You knew Him without Him and had the law written on your heart without the law. Boss Man authored a bestseller for you a while back and you might find some surprises in there that no one told you about before. They lied to you about Boss Man. You can find my favourite make by Thomas Nelson that I hug to sleep without messing the pages up. Give Him a chance and He wants to show you His love. You might be surprised like I was and still is every day. It’s the house telling you to close your eyes and think with what’s in your head rather than what’s in your chest. The house is liar, liar, pants on fire now.If you disbelieve then I look forward to the day I told you so, but I will take my time and enjoy this adventure of a lifetime with Boss Man. I know we win in the end. We already won. I saw it that night.Turns out He didn’t need me to choose Him when mankind turned its back on Him. I need to choose Him when no one believes me. I chased Him to Bristol the weekend after I believed and it was one of the rabbit holes I got wrong and realised I had been an idiot, but I stayed in Bristol for the night. That evening, the song through which He baptised me with the Holy Spirit played again and He put something on my head and my right hand. I searched scripture myself and asked Pastor Xander from the Hong Kong Baptist Church if God ever gave men anything that is on their right hand. The three possibilities I found were scrolls, a sceptre, and chains if I’m the devil. I had been trying to be extremely subtle when it comes to understanding my role and the plan He has for me throughout this journey when speaking to pastors and theologians, which has only made them stop replying to my messages and emails.When He came to save me back in August, the three things He promised me were to show me what I want to see, take me where I want to go, and glory. I had zero interest in the last one and did not care for it. I hated people’s attention growing up and was fine with sitting at the back as the quiet kid without attracting any attention. I have never had a birthday party and I never wanted one. I was exceptionally grateful and content for my life of 27 years except occasionally getting bored before finding another weird and seemingly impossible challenge to research and come up with whacky ideas using my weird imagination. Until a bunch of ungrateful mofos decided to mess up my first proper holiday with consecutive backstabbing whilst I dealt with a mental breakdown. I later found out glory belongs to Him and as God’s children, we can share His glory with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I’m happy with just a tiny bit of that as a formality or whatever if He insists on giving that to me since He did save my life, but otherwise, I’m happy to sit amongst the audience and clap as usual. I prayed for Him to take back whatever I believed He gave me whilst in Bristol. I had a go at this messiah thing and I would have been the last person on earth to apply for that job if He didn’t give me those things and the coincidences I encountered in scripture. Heavy is the head that wears the crown and my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ’s resume beats mine any time any day. I had the second or third lowest grade of my year at Oxford, got a third class and nearly didn’t graduate. I failed the Machine Learning module so maybe I know dick about the dangers of AI.I told Him I wanted to save as many people as possible, especially my community and I believe He’s happy for me to do that. I still got most of the Bible to study, but as far as I can tell, we have been lied to about who He is actually like and most of the fucking scribes and Pharisees do not know God personally no matter how well they believe they know scripture. They didn’t seem to even get the basic order of precedence right before judging my community. We had to learn how to love by ourselves without the Lord and these lying mofos have the fucking audacity to call us an abomination when they were also an abomination and never knew love and hence God.John 5:39[39] You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, (ESV)Matthew 23:13[13] “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. [14] Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation (ESV)So I’m going to go back to being Aaron Fucking Yang which I was exceptionally happy and content with, and I asked Him to please hurry up and sort out this fucking mess that is humanity so that I can finally take my couple hundred years of fucking holiday. I have slept on my bed less than half a dozen times since getting kicked out of the Rosebay gay/bi-naturist campsite in July last year and had to move all of my camping gear back to my London flat because an unfaithful former business partner decided to back out of helping me the very fucking last minute and kicked me out of my own fucking company after I begged her to help me or I go bankrupt. She did not lift a single fucking finger and received £50k from the fruit of my labour the year prior. I’m happy to just be who I am but tell the truth as far as I’m capable of grasping it as a mere mortal. I had and still have zero interest in receiving any praise from anyone and I fucking hate people staring at me. I have taken less than a handful of selfies in the last decade and I fucking hate looking at myself in photos. I will still be polite, but it’s time to stop fucking being nice to the ungrateful fucking cunts and mofos who keep taking and only give when they expect more returned. They are running out of time regardless. What’s the point if you are already living in hell and will end up in hell for eternity anyway?This is the message I believe I was supposed to bring to the world and I preached it to the choir in the US during my global tour.The Book of Revelation has started. There will be hard times ahead. He is coming back. Please hold onto your faith and best wishes.I did not continue confidently preaching that message after returning to London because the bestseller is annoyingly thick, I never believed in myself and was in fear of making mistakes my entire life. I’m also not in the business of predicting the future other than for a couple of seconds in financial markets given my purely scientific materialistic education and my epistemological stance. Despite He gave me a get-out-of-jail-free card three months ago, I just sat on it hoping to get confirmations from the scribes and Pharisees. I got nothing except mental health referrals and avoidance of eye contact. I have asked Him for a sign for the first time and we will see. I also needed time for people to rob everything and leave me to burn and for Him to heal my broken heart. I wasn’t ready and somehow Dude’s super cool and considerate with that.My Spotify playlist has grown from 300+ in late August last year to 3,081 at the moment of writing. I like Boss Man’s taste in music and He’s a dope DJ for sure.I asked in my heart one question about Him for the only time in my life and I was being philosophically dramatic because of Nietzsche. And He showed up to save me five weeks later. I knew nothing about the Holy Spirit and I thought He gave me superpowers if He was indeed God. After witnessing speaking in tongue for the first time which confirmed the presence of the Holy Spirit for me, He also touched my back after I confessed my sexuality to the welcoming party He prepared for me 11 years ago before I even bought the plane ticket to London. It burnt a lot, but I checked after and there was no mark.I mentioned previously that I sought after truth and knowledge my entire life and turns out they are written on the bestseller in mankind’s history, and took a 540-degree turn in life. Maybe I didn’t take a 540-degree after all, I was seeking Him this whole time and I found Him at age 27. Another bucket list item checkmarked. Added salvation and homecoming party preparation.Matthew 5:2–12The Beatitudes[2] And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:[3] “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.[4] “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.[5] “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.[6] “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.[7] “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.[8] “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.[9] “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.[10] “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.[11] “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. [12] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

I spent the entire week in bed feeling utterly drained and looking at the wreckage that is my life, despite my desire to clean up my mess, I could not find a single ounce of strength after everyone turned their backs on me. I could not comprehend why they decided to take all that I had left after giving them all I could with the best of intentions. I searched my heart and soul and concluded that the only thing I could do was forgive and move on. The shame and humiliation in my defeat make letting go easier said than done, but it is my only viable option, considering how little I still have.Frankly, I do not know how I have developed such a severe saviour complex since reading the Book of Jonah for the first time less than 20 weeks ago. I was doing fine keeping to myself for the first 27 years of my life and not interested in this saving the world business except by giving as much spare change as I had in my pocket whenever I passed a homeless person—time to sort out my shit before trying to help anyone I guess.His ways, not mine.Edit: It turns out this is me 🤡. I have tried being Jonah Troublemaker Yang, which has brought me enough trouble. That is a sure sign from the Lord telling me that I should return to being who I was, but I stand by my concerns regarding the danger of Artificial Intelligence and will put my money where my mouth is once I start making them again. Also, I need to find two witnesses again for my name change deed poll. 🥲Isaiah 49:4[4] But I said, “I have labored in vain;        I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;yet surely my right is with the LORD,        and my recompense with my God.” (ESV)" }, { "title": "On Sprinkle and Startle", "url": "/posts/on-sprinkle-and-startle/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2025-02-03 12:58:00 +0000", "snippet": "As mentioned in a previous post, I was feeling quite ill from the leftover shame after spending an entire weekend verifying my accounts on several popular video-sharing platforms and posting my New...", "content": "As mentioned in a previous post, I was feeling quite ill from the leftover shame after spending an entire weekend verifying my accounts on several popular video-sharing platforms and posting my New Year’s present to the world in an attempt to bring my community back to my Boss. Whilst trying to pull myself back together from the humiliation of showing my nakedness to the world, I stumbled across the servant songs in the Book of Isaiah concerning a suffering servant whose identity is a central disagreement between Judaism and Christianity. The most suitable word to describe how I felt when I read Isaiah 52:15 was startled.Isaiah 52:15[15] so shall he sprinkle many nations.        Kings shall shut their mouths because of him,for that which has not been told them they see,        and that which they have not heard they understand. (ESV)If you read my posts prior, I was in the middle of an extra-potent salt-sprinkling campaign with email and Spotify Ads to warn as many people as possible concerning the imminent danger of Artificial Intelligence, which I believe could cause unemployment rates at an unprecedented global scale. You could argue that it could be yet another “coincident” like all the coincidences I have encountered in this 19-week and 1-day journey. When researching the servant songs for interpretations in Judaism and Christianity to learn about the scholars’ thoughts and opinions concerning said servant, I discovered two translations from Hebrew to English for the verb sprinkle; the other possible translation was the suffering servant will startle many nations.If you are not a member of my community or not hella gay, then my educated guess would be you were probably startled when you opened my New Year present to the world.I was pretty happy with my old life in the first 27 years, partying like there was no tomorrow every night at the basement of Berghain as a rampant homosexual and perfect attendance every month at FickstutenMarkt (extremely NSFW in case you want to google it) in Berlin’s KitKat Club whilst making mid six figures as a digital nomad juggling multiple software engineering jobs remotely.I had thought God would hate someone like me based on my stereotypical understanding of religion growing up. Therefore, I was exceptionally annoyed at how natural and smooth things were since starting my latest employment as a Christian intern for Boss Man. I keep picturing the angels laughing their asses off in heaven every time I stumbled across another “coincidence” in scripture. The most irritating thing is that I have never had this much fun at work, and I get to exercise my wild imagination to an unparalleled degree. I am restraining myself due to my timid and insecure nature, and I spend most of my time overthinking every possible edge case due to my occupational habits for managing risk when I was writing algorithmic trading systems.Last week, I was still emailing pastors and theologians, seeking confirmation and reassurance. As usual, I did not get a reply. I realised that my desire to seek approval from them stems from the fact that I have not trusted myself for my entire life and have lived in fear of making mistakes. I still do not trust myself, and unfortunately, at this point, not many people are willing to offer me counsel or even reply to my messages and emails anymore.I saw speaking in tongues the second time 8 weeks after I believed whilst attending an evening gathering for 20s and 30s for the first time at a church nearby. The stranger I met for the first time in my life started speaking in tongues halfway through, and she brought me a personal message from Boss Man. He sees me even in the parts that I hide away from myself, and nothing I do will make Him turn His back on me. I finally know what He meant by that. Throughout this 19-week and 1-day journey, I kept discovering the meaning of faith and worked out the relationship between love, faith and hope not that long ago. I realised I did not need to trust myself at all. I have a better and best option: I can trust Him. I realised the root cause of fear and worry is the lack of faith and trust in Him catching me when I make mistakes. All I need to do is trust Him more than fear or worry about making mistakes. Besides, fear and worry only work when I have something to lose. I have nothing left to lose after the last 15 months. What do they say about someone who has nothing to lose? Well, this guy with nothing left to lose is coming for you.Little Lion Man - Song by Mumford &amp; SonsWeep for yourself, my manYou’ll never be what is in your heartWeep, little lion manYou’re not as brave as you were at the startRate yourself and rake yourselfTake all the courage you have leftAnd waste it on fixing all the problemsThat you made in your own headBut it was not your fault but mineAnd it was your heart on the lineI really fucked it up this timeDidn’t I, my dear?Didn’t I, my-Tremble for yourself, my manYou know that you have seen this all beforeTremble, little lion manYou’ll never settle any of your scoresYour grace is wasted in your faceYour boldness stands alone among the wreckNow learn from your mother or elseSpend your days biting your own neckBut it was not your fault but mineAnd it was your heart on the lineI really fucked it up this timeDidn’t I, my dear?You could argue that I am utterly delusional and living in a daydream completely detached from reality.

I realised I was a lot more naive and childish than I had thought and cried my eyes out every other day these months. I came across Matthew 25:31-46 the other day and wondered whether there is a way for us to recognise the sheep and the goats in our lives. Boss Man looks at the heart, and it will be easy-peasy for Him on that day.Matthew 25:31–33The Final Judgment[31] “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. (ESV)I spent some time reflecting on my relationships with friends and family. One simple question might be sufficient to tell the sheep from the goats. What is the cross that they are bearing?I also devised a sheep or goat self-test for reference only. What did you do when you last passed a homeless person on the street? Did your heart tremble if you had nothing to give or did not give? Goat if the answer is no; otherwise, sheep.Bearing the cross means taking up burdens and responsibilities of my own volition for the benefit of others without expecting any return. After completing my dance degree at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, I returned to London. I took up financial and parental responsibilities to look after my younger siblings. The family fortune had been declining for over a decade, and I wanted to give my younger siblings the same opportunities I enjoyed as the firstborn. In Chinese culture, the firstborn also bears the responsibility of carrying the family name, and my sexuality meant that there would be a difficult conversation with my parents on a future date. Therefore, looking after my siblings also partially alleviated the guilt of not fulfilling the expectations of the firstborn.I arrived at the Rosebay campsite on 10 April and got kicked out on 19 July last year. It was precisely 100 days, and I lived in total agony for over a month until He came to save me on 25 August. I arrived in the United Kingdom on 26 August 2013, 11 years ago. In those five weeks, I searched my heart and soul, trying to figure out what I did wrong at the campsite to become public enemy number one despite having only good intentions to help the community.The ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID-19 that came true involves a time machine and a specific Austrian artist who played a significant role in the Second World War. Suppose every attempt to use the time machine to travel back in time to stop the Austrian artist from committing atrocious acts leads to the end of humanity before the 21st century due to the uncontrolled development of nuclear weapons. Effectively, the atrocious acts were a costly lesson for humanity to define a redline that we should never get close to again. What could we say about the actions of the notorious Austrian artist in light of this piece of information? There is no doubt that the atrocious acts were evil, and the Austrian artist was an absolute madman. The thought experiment further supposes the Austrian artist was so mad that he believed he had only good intentions for the future of humanity, either through imaginative madness or perhaps divine intervention.I thought I had become like the Austrian artist when I got kicked out of the campsite. I had only good intentions of providing full-site Wi-Fi coverage to benefit the campsite guests. Still, I became public enemy number one and got kicked out. My ethical system imploded because I realised that regardless of my intentions, the development of events and perceptions by other people was entirely out of my control. I did not know what was good and what was evil anymore. No one at the campsite replied to my messages or explained what I did wrong after they kicked me out except my neighbour, who also left the campsite shortly after. After putting everything together, I realised I had been gaslighted and manipulated by the campsite boss, John. I was shell-shocked when John’s partner unleashed a barrage of accusations on me, and I thought we were on good terms, as we had been during our last conversation.In hindsight, what I saw and heard in those 100 days at the campsite could be summarised with the following passages in Romans 1.Romans 1:28–32[28] And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. [29] They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, [30] slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, [31] foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. [32] Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them. (ESV)Shortly after writing a previous post, I realised that I had already quoted the answer to my confusion. I should perhaps do less overthinking in the future. I’m not sure if the atheists realise that God’s omnipotence means creating a universe where you find no evidence of His existence is entirely within His capabilities. And we humans, by definition, are not omnipotent and, therefore, would not know whether He exists even if we lack evidence. Have you tried inquiring about His existence? If you still reject the possibility of God’s existence after all the testimonies available and rational debates with reason, I would like to ask, what have you done?John 3:19–21[19] And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. [20] For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. [21] But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.” (ESV)The good news is, it does not matter if you are a murderer, a rapist, or an atheist; there is hope and opportunity to mend things with God before that day. He is good and faithful. Turn, and He will heal you.1 John 1:9[9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

For unbelievers, that is understandable, and I have been working on it. The remarkably annoying thing is even Christians don’t believe me most of the time. Hence I do most of my shouting and bitching on this blog. I have got to let the steam out somewhere.Yesterday, I stumbled across the Book of Malachi in the Old Testament while tracking down some of the 70% experience through scripture. The references also led me to Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, which I learned are part of five books collectively known as The Law. My relationship with the Lord is my first love relationship. Since deriving the equation of love at age 16, I considered myself a purely rational stoic and incapable of perceiving love. I was not even sure whether I loved my parents. I knew one day they would pass away, and it could be before or after I passed away. Both are heartbreaking and I had feared that since I was a child until I decided to accept them as facts and moved on. I thought I had mentally prepared myself, and I probably would not feel too emotional if I were to find out my parents had passed away on any day.Despite my lack of experience in the area, I will make a clumsy attempt to describe how I felt yesterday. Reading the Book of Malachi and the bits and pieces in Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy were like reading a boyfriend/girlfriend’s diary since childhood or social media history and learning about their past. As mentioned in my previous posts, I was constantly scared by the possibility of being a false prophet, an antichrist, or even satan throughout this journey. I added the abomination of desolation to that list yesterday and I kinda understand why the scribes and Pharisees stopped replying to my emails and messages.Leviticus 18:22[22] You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (ESV)Leviticus 20:13[13] If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. (ESV)Before this journey, my worldview was entirely based on scientific materialism, and I knew about my sexuality since I was 11 or 12. Before anyone asks again, no, girls don’t work. I more or less heard about the incompatibility between homosexuality and religion, and my understanding based on stereotypes was that the God in the major religions would hate someone like me. Therefore, I did not make any effort to inquire about God.As mentioned in a recent post, I know three things besides cogito, ergo sum. He exists, I exist, and He loves me. You need to make me question my existence before I question His existence. But yesterday, I questioned whether He loves me after reading about how mad He was about various matters. I did wonder if I am indeed that far gone mentally to have imagined all of this in my head. If you read my posts, you would know I was a crazy guy with a wild imagination. Previously, nothing was impossible or unthinkable for me as long as they did not violate physics or legal requirements. I don’t think you can quite imagine what confirming God’s existence did to my imagination. I only wrote about the noteworthy events in my posts. I go down a side quest every other day and emerge from the rabbit hole feeling like an absolute dumbass and a clown.I have read those two verses in Leviticus before, and I consider my sexuality part of my share of sins that my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, died on the cross for. It’s also part of the cross I am taking up to follow Christ. What frightened me yesterday was how angry the Lord was on various related matters. Unlike the Catholics, I cannot abandon scripture because I converted via reading Romans 1-4, which also made Judaism impossible since they do not recognise the New Testament. How, then, could I know He loves me, knowing that I should be put to death according to The Law? Well, I don’t see how they do it in Judaism, but here is how my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ does it.Matthew 22:36–40[36] “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” [37] And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. [38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (ESV)1 Peter 4:7–9[7] The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. [8] Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. [9] Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. (ESV)Matthew 12:31[31] Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. (ESV)Hebrews 11:31[31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies. (ESV)Romans 3:21–26The Righteousness of God Through Faith[21] But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—[22] the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [25] whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. [26] It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. (ESV)By the way, if you look down on my community because we are an abomination, then my bad news for you is so are you if you have told a lie before.Proverbs 6:16–19[16] There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:[17] haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,[18] a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,[19] a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers. (ESV)I have also realised that some Christians might consider some of my posts prophesying. I have a purely scientific materialistic education, and I had no idea how prophesies worked. After my study yesterday, I realised that people who discarded my logical reasoning and did not read my pinned posts could interpret my writing as prophesying. It seems like most people nowadays choose either God or reason instead of both.I was also super confused when people accused me of misusing the Lord’s name or suggested referring to God as my Boss as a sign of disrespect. I realised yesterday that if they had only known God through scripture and judged my writing through appearances, then indeed, I should be put to death by now. Fortunately, the God I came to know personally with confirmations in scripture looks at the heart rather than appearances. I have used Boss, Dude, and Big Man to refer to God, and they are my love nicknames for Him. He is the Lord, and I’m a servant; therefore, He’s my Boss. Jesus is a friend and a Dude to me especially when I find Him annoying, usually because He showed me my stupidity. He’s the Father that I can lean on, hence Big Man.Now that I have completed this scary side quest, I will seal the deal with something confirmed by the Holy Spirit. I know three things besides cogito, ergo sum. He exists, He loves me, and I exist, in that order. You need to make me question my existence before I question His existence and His love for me.However, now I wonder if some of the pastors and theologians I met were truly saved and whether they knew God personally or just through scripture. I finally met my guide who spoke in tongues back in September when I confessed my sexuality, and I went to his church for the last two weekends. Some pastors and theologians I met would call the mental hospital nearby and tell them to bring a bus if they attended the same worship. I found out over 90% of my friends were fake recently. I’m scared.Matthew 23:13[13] “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. (ESV)I have come to the unfortunate conclusion that I have tried my best to make people believe. I have only succeeded in alienating everyone, both believers and unbelievers. The only way for people to believe I’ve been telling the truth is if my predictions in the letter come true. I prefer going insane than seeing the suffering with 90% global unemployment rates. When I was in Israel two weeks ago, I seriously considered checking myself into a mental facility when I’m back in London. I think I will get a six-figure job again if not multiple, and all-in on the global stock market put options. I will try pulling The Big Short on this and see if I can buy a publisher like Thomas Nelson. Many people could use mankind’s best seller if I were right. I have removed the buy me a coffee link so that people know I have nothing to gain. I will finish sprinkling with my email campaign and call it a day.Even though I consider what the campsite boss John and my former friend Meiling did to me abject evil, and on a bad day, when looking at the wreckage that is my life, I wouldn’t even mind burning in hell for eternity with them as long as their evil deeds are punished. I do look forward to the day that my Boss comes back and I get to heaven, but do you know what would be better than going to heaven? Wrap up some work stuff on my laptop, riding shotgun in Meiling’s Range Rover whilst feeling the full centripetal force on roundabouts and corners. She goes around them at full speed. Rock up to the gate of heaven from the car park and see John and his partner Dean waiting at the entrance with their Labradoodles. Get a bear hug from John before walking in together. John is very bulky and quite comfortable to hug and has a broad shoulder suitable for crying on when your world outside the campsite falls apart. It has only been 131 days since I believed, and as previously mentioned, I did not have anyone in my life who talked about Jesus. I want to see every one of my friends in heaven; otherwise, it would be a lonely start. That includes every “friend” who did not buy me coffee." }, { "title": "On Paranoia and Delusion", "url": "/posts/on-paranoia-and-delusion/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2025-01-28 04:17:00 +0000", "snippet": "If you are a faithless unbeliever, you might think, OMG, this guy must be a paranoid and delusional nutjob after gracefully reading through my 250+ posts written since the end of October last year....", "content": "If you are a faithless unbeliever, you might think, OMG, this guy must be a paranoid and delusional nutjob after gracefully reading through my 250+ posts written since the end of October last year. I want to express my wholehearted gratitude to you for taking the precious time from your busy schedule of drug taking. I appreciate that modern life is hard, and I went through some stuff in the last 15 months. Still, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I hope the good news I’m bringing you can take away the burden of this age and break the yoke on your neck. You might be able to tell the prince of the power of the air to fuck off as well when the time is right.If you are a somewhat faithful believer and wonder why I’m going through all this trouble instead of watching Netflix and chilling to wait for Boss Man to come back, then I suspect you might not end up where you believe you will be going after my recent experience with Isaiah 22. You sound like a Shebna (Isaiah 22:15) to me and feel free to get off your lazy ass and start following Boss Man when you are ready. Hurry, though, I have a weird feeling He might be coming back soon, but Dude annoyingly likes to take His time after 2,000 years. So I dunno either. It is up to you.For the last 28 years, I never once thought I was right about anything with absolute certainty, and I didn’t even trust myself. My entire life, I was in fear of making mistakes. Whatever I did, I sought confirmation and reassurance before every decision that mattered, regardless of significance to me or to anyone. At the beginning of this 128-day journey, I was absolutely petrified of the possibility that I was not on the good side after seeing the resemblances in the Book of Revelation with events I went through in real life over the last 15 months. If you find the “coincidences” I described in my posts hard to believe, then all I can say is they are vanilla compared to the experiences I did not write down. I had a hard time convincing people of the vanilla 30% and I received mental health and A&amp;E referrals from both pastors and theologians. We never managed to get past the 30%, and I’m not assed to share the remaining 70% anymore.If you are a member of my community, i.e. you are hella gay, and you received my New Year present to the world, I have one question for you. Was my masterpiece glorious enough for you? If you are not a homosexual, then you can find my New Year present to the world by searching “Hi Jonah Dot Com” under the abominable section of P***hub and xH***ter. If you are from a jurisdiction that does not have access to those two popular video-sharing platforms, you could also download the present in this post. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The process of identity verification was a lot stricter than I anticipated. The moment I decided not to cover my face from the world and lay down my dignity and my life for the love of the world last October, I had nothing left and nothing more to prove to men.Before I dived into mainland China to preach Jonah style in early October last year on my second week as a believer, I went to the Hong Kong Baptist Church and spoke with Pastor Xander. I told him what I intended to do. I was in an extremely agitated and doubtful state, seeking clarity and reassurance. After listening to what I had to say in my usual 6,000-miles-in-5-minutes fashion, Pastor Xander did not try to convince or stop me by reasoning with me. Roughly the same age as me, an economics graduate from LSE, Pastor Xander suggested that we pray together. I cried halfway through the prayer and it was the first time I agreed to another person praying for me in my presence. If my friend Vaibhav were to ask me who I trust in life again today, I would say I trust people who lean not into their own understanding but put their trust in the Lord, our Saviour Jesus Christ. You can read about my reasoning and experience concerning the relationship between love, faith and hope in this post.I barely yelled at anyone in the first 27 years of my life. In the last 15 months, I gave everything to those I loved. The Rosebay campsite boss John Donald and my former friend and business partner Meiling Wang backstabbed me to death, and I found out nearly all my friends were fake. I barely asked for any help of significance in my life, and the only thing I did in the last six months was ask. I was absolutely stunned by the reaction of the people I once thought would extend a helping hand when in need. Turns out I got it wrong and most of my relationships were worth not more than a cup of coffee. I did ask the Lord to send help continuously without ceasing and got consistently annoyed by my impatience, knowing His timing is perfect, and He gives what I need rather than what I want. Then this past weekend, I read Isaiah 59 in the Old Testament.Isaiah 59:14–15Judgment and Redemption[14] Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away;for truth has stumbled in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter.[15] Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.Isaiah 59:16–17[16] He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intercede;then his own arm brought him salvation, and his righteousness upheld him.[17] He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head;he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak. (ESV)I have been praying for Him to take away my wrath since Rome, and He has not done that yet. Scripture talks about righteous anger and warns us against sinning in the heat of the moment. Unless He takes away my wrath, my working assumption is that my anger is justified, and righteous and evil deeds will be repaid in full in due course. Barely anyone saw me truly angry before, including my parents. I will show you that if you so desperately want to see. Let’s see if the money you make today turns into toilet paper tomorrow. My plan is to stir up as much shit as possible, sexual innuendo fully intended.Ephesians 4:26–27[26] Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, [27] and give no opportunity to the devil. (ESV)Love the Way You LieSong by Eminem, partial lyrics belowJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?Well, that’s all right because I like the way it hurtsJust gonna stand there and hear me cry?Well, that’s all right because I love the way you lieI love the way you lieDon’t worry—I will not touch a single hair on anyone. You can say I have a death wish all you want. If you choose a lie, evil and unrighteousness over the Lord, truth, reason and love, then you have an even bigger death wish than me, and you have already condemned yourself to death as punishment. Why would I bother touching a single hair if the fools and idiots will be receiving the worst punishment for eternity while I enjoy some German beer with the likes of Isaiah and the legendary Mr Noisy Gong? According to the mail I received when I was busy getting scammed in Jerusalem two weeks ago, I should receive some court documents this week. Let’s see if I can put the check mark on another prophecy before I become homeless. Rent is nearly four months overdue now.Matthew 24:14[14] And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. (ESV)A gay theologian friend asked me how certain I was regarding my warning letter to the world. I had discussions with computer scientists from Imperial College London and King’s College London. They were more pessimistic than I was. I believe I have confirmation from the Holy Spirit. Last but not least, in the previous 128 days, I have been to Hong Kong, Shen Zhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Macau, California, New York City, Rome, Istanbul, Moscow, and Israel. I also built the project Bible Says Love and wrote 250+ posts. I’m currently scraping the internet with three 1U servers I purchased while caravaning using the scraping tool I built in less than half an hour with ChatGPT. A handful of real friends provided financial help recently, but no one came and offered a helping hand except Him. I could have saved all those tears I cried for my fake friends. I have Him annoying me through Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber when I’m busy scraping the email addresses of the Assyrians.By the way, the “friend” who reminded me about God’s distaste for swearing is a former colleague of mine. I got a free vacuum cleaner worth £230 as part of the black Friday deal when I purchased the drone in November. I could no longer afford Uber and it would be difficult to transport everything home from central London. My former employer’s office is near the DJI store in Oxford Circus. I gave the former colleague the vacuum cleaner for free as an early Christmas present. The only thing I asked in return was to buy me a coffee and they promised. I’m still waiting on that cup of coffee and I know they did not forget. I still had LinkedIn Premium till not long ago and saw them checking out my profile. (7 Feb 2025 Edit: It turns out the former colleague did buy me coffee, and being the idiot that I am, I managed to miss that. I genuinely appreciate that and hope you can forgive my stupidity)If you could not find the time from drug taking to check, the wonder/sign/miracle our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ said 2,000 years ago He would give to an evil and adulterous generation when they ask for a sign was the sign of Jonah.If you are a faithless motherfucker and would like to know how fucked you will be, here are the links to my masterpiece on P***hub and xH***ter (Extremely NSFW).

I ended up in Israel the week later and mistakenly thought I was going home, but I got scammed in Jerusalem on the first day for 300 shekels and could not check into the hotel I booked since I ran out of money, yet again.Before I travelled to Israel and when I was checking references to call specific world leaders sexually promiscuous, I found out Jonah is the only one of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Hebrew Bible to be named in the Quran as well. I further went down the rabbit hole from the Wikipedia page for the Book of Jonah into Typology and Exegesis. I have yet to emerge from the rabbit hole and will likely have more to say about these two fancy words later on, but as alluded to in my prior posts, humanity’s best seller is the closest thing to magic I have experienced in 28 years of life. Before almost pooping myself yet again, thanks to Isaiah three weeks ago, I had only experienced the magic through the New Testament. I built the project Bible Says Love to help me study Boss Man’s knowledge and wisdom. You can read about them in my ~250 earlier posts with as much or as little scepticism as you want. I don’t give two shits if a faithless motherfucker believes me or not.I read Isaiah 20 to 60 in reverse order over the weekend and found them too interesting. I enjoy walking into a brand-new adventure or exploration with zero knowledge and as little external influence as possible. I did that for the four undergraduate degrees I studied in the last decade, and it’s also the reason why I bought a brand new caravan with no prior camping or caravaning experience within two weeks last April. And therefore, I got increasingly annoyed when I realised I could comprehend the super annoying texts and map them into the real world. I find them irritating because those words have the weird ability to give me the sense that the more I understand them, the greater the yet-to-be-revealed mysteries behind them are. I believe it’s known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, and you should read about the effect if you have yet to experience it.I spent today reading Isaiah 22 with modern interpretations on BibleRef since I did not pay attention at all in history classes when I was in school. I needed to scratch my itch after comprehending the texts on an abstract and metaphysical level and correlating them to real-world events. Learning from modest scholars, scribes, and Pharisees would not necessarily be that bad. I kept signing and shaking my head as I worked through Isaiah 22 on BibleRef. As it turns out, Isaiah and I had a lot more in common than exposing our nakedness to the world. Beer will be on me when I meet him in heaven; it must also be German beer. I could not comprehend why anyone would enjoy the bitter AF German beer in my previous life. Now I can.There were countless times in the last 18 weeks when I wanted to burn the world and capitalism down and hated the coldness of hearts of the people who I once thought were my friends. I kicked, screamed and shouted to call for repentance and took away reason from underneath their feet. None turned around and continued taking drugs. I have realised now that there is no need for me to be angry or worked up since they have already condemned themselves to death by choosing a lie, evil and unrighteousness for profit over God, truth, reason and love. Isaiah and I will have a minute of silence and remembrance over your death before enjoying our beer and laughing at your demise and stupidity.After reading the interpretation of Isaiah 22 on BibleRef, I felt tired and speechless. If I were Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, I would shut the gates after shouting for 18 weeks, and none came, and throw the key away. I did not intend to read Isaiah 23, but then I saw the ships of Tarshish mentioned. Jonah fell asleep on a ship to Tarshish when he tried to run away from the Lord.I returned to London from Israel on Saturday, a little over a week ago. Modern-day Israel is the city of Tyre, and Jerusalem is filled with merchants and crooks. Israel and the house of Judah have whored her youth for riches and prostituted herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. The spyware used by Saudi Arabia to hack Jamal Khashoggi’s phone and contributed to the journalist’s brutal murder was made in Israel by cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group. Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018 and never came out. A hit team dismembered his body. According to reports, a particular head of state “did not have any knowledge” about the incident, and the returned golden calf was OK with his FWB as long as he could afford $450bn.I seriously need to take a chill pill, especially after pulling all-nighters consecutively in the last few weeks. I’m going to have some fun with my FWBs. Rest assured. There is no root of all evil involved—just some good old mechanical movement with written consent from all involved parties.I am looking forward to taking care of the Assyrians soon and watching them bury their heads in the sand by taking away reason from underneath their feet. Did you know that they probably invented the wheel? The Assyrians were a bright bunch and made significant advancements in mathematics, astronomy, medicine and technology during their advancement in warfare. Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire.Isaiah 31:8–9[8] “And the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man; and a sword, not of man, shall devour him;and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be put to forced labor.[9] His rock shall pass away in terror, and his officers desert the standard in panic,”declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.

If that is not the case for you, I’m sorry for your experience and hope you have recovered. Unfortunately, my following argument will not apply to your case.If you have not seen death before, then may I ask how do you know for sure you will die? My guess is you have heard about it since the beginning and have probably seen it depicted on television and in books. Well, guess what? So is my Boss.Once again, I hold a negative sentiment towards eternal life due to the events of the last 15 months, and frankly, I couldn’t wait to nap for eternity. I’m still highly annoyed about some motherfuckers fucking up the first proper holiday I took for myself last April.It appears to me that “we all die” has become a slogan and justification for the terminally ill from nihilism to justify doing whatever the hell they want and be indifferent to the suffering of others. And they have the audacity to claim that is how the world works and blame human nature.I constructed this argument hoping you would become aware of your insufficient thinking in epistemology. Once again, please read the first two chapters of René Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy.Suppose you still want to argue about the possibility of eternal life for argument’s sake and assuming you have submitted any academic assignment online. What is the most prominent warning message you will receive before submission? If you believe you are a purely “rational” “thinker”, then may I ask whether you have read and understood every single chain of logical reasoning, examined every piece of experimental equipment, and checked the validity of the data in the scientific publications that you “believe” in?Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy employed methodic doubt and is arguably the granddaddy of modern scientific methods. Could I make a personal plea for you to shut the fuck up and educate yourself before spewing out illogical nonsense for the sake of attention? Thank you.I’m sorry for the choice of language again.

I had no idea Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel received similar orders. What an interesting coincidence! It also has a special name: “sign and portent.”This makes me feel bad for the campsite boss, John, my former friend/business partner Meiling, and every “friend” who either ghosted me or outright blocked me.Just repent, please.Isaiah 20:2–4[2] at that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loose the sackcloth from your waist and take off your sandals from your feet,” and he did so, walking naked and barefoot.[3] Then the LORD said, “As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush, [4] so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptian captives and the Cushite exiles, both the young and the old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt. (ESV)From BibleRef:The Lord tells His prophet to do something truly strange in this verse. Bible scholars describe this as an “enacted” or “role-played” prophecy. This is when God tells a prophet to do something specific and purposefully odd to call the attention of the people. This is the only time Isaiah is called upon by God to act out such a message. But elsewhere in the Old Testament, both Ezekiel and Jeremiah also became visual object lessons (Jeremiah 27:1–5; Ezekiel 4:1–8).God instructs Isaiah to take off the sackcloth he is wearing—his outer garment—as well as his sandals, and to walk around without them. The term translated into English as “naked” has a broader meaning than “completely unclothed.” It’s not likely Isaiah was commanded to appear entirely nude. Nor does this necessarily mean he appeared in that condition every moment for three years (Isaiah 20:3). Rather, he was probably “stripped” down to a humbling and embarrassing level, such as only in a loincloth. He would have appeared in the same state as a war captive or prisoner.A possible interpretation of this verse is that the Lord told Isaiah to act in this manner before the Assyrians defeated Ashdod. The words “at that time” might indicate that Isaiah began his ministry of walking around in exposed disgrace three years earlier. The fall of Ashdod could have been the fulfillment of his visual prophecy.The following verse shows what Isaiah’s “nakedness” was meant to warn the people of Judah about." }, { "title": "On Eternal Life", "url": "/posts/on-eternal-life/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2025-01-24 01:05:00 +0000", "snippet": "If you think the motive behind my faith is eternal life, all I can say is that I wanted to nap for eternity every other day throughout this journey because of people.

I tried to take my first proper holiday in April last year, and some motherfuckers decided to fuck it up for me. The only thing that kept me going and raised my spirit every time was His love.On Monday evening, I attended a discussion on God’s existence organised by the King’s College London Philosophy Society and chatted with a couple of attendees. One of them wanted to know why a righteous God would allow the existence of sin and evil in this world. My answer to that was disobedience. It was not God who brought sin to this world; it was our disobedience and rebellion that allowed and sustained the existence of sin and suffering. I also told them that I would have thrown myself out of the balcony more than a dozen times now if I didn’t have Him.They also had difficulty seeing God’s work in their life and the world. I suggested that they keep an open mind and give Him a chance to show them His love. I don’t think we could ever accurately describe an omnipotent being since we are, by definition, not omnipotent, but if I had to choose one word to describe Him, then it would be love.The legendary Mr Noisy Gong once said love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. For me, knowing Him is knowing Love, and knowing Love is knowing Him. Do you know Love? Do you believe? Do you have hope?Matthew 22:34–40The Great Commandment[34] But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. [35] And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. [36] “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” [37] And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. [38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” (ESV)1 Peter 4:7–11[7] The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. [8] Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. [9] Show hospitality to one another without grumbling. [10] As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace: [11] whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. (ESV)1 Corinthians 13The Way of Love[1] If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. [2] And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. [3] If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.[4] Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant [5] or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; [6] it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. [7] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.[8] Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. [11] When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. [12] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.[13] So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

Despite the countless suggestions from people I respect to tone down the language, I decided to keep the good, the bad, and the ugly due to the fakeness I discovered in this 122-day journey of faith.The week after getting kicked out of the gay/bi-naturist campsite Rosebay, I could barely speak a complete sentence, and I had to take extremely long pauses every couple of words when I was talking to my parents over video calls. My mind was spinning at 1,000% capacity for nearly an entire month, and I replayed everything in my mind for those three months at the campsite. I altered every possible variable my mind could remember to discover what went wrong and how the ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID came true in real life.I lived in extreme horror daily because I realised we could never honestly know people’s true intentions. I will discuss the ethical thought experiment in detail in a future post, but as a consequence, I thought I had become like the infamous Austrian artist who made a name for himself in the first half of the last century. My entire moral system got blown to pieces and the only way that I could think of to prove my innocence was suicide. Not long after, He welcomed me into His house through Flo Rida’s song - My House.He told me to say what I must and don’t hold back. I decided to do as told since only a handful of people from my past still read and reply to my messages. Does anyone still make real shit in this world? I will still be polite when conversing with people since I consider that an essential principle for a decent human being. However, I will call you a motherfucker and a cunt if you are behaving like a motherfucker and a cunt.Throughout this journey, I was dumbfounded every time I cornered a “rational” “thinker” with reason. They would give up their entire reasoning faculty by metaphorically digging a hole and burying their heads in it. As mentioned in my posts, I was an agnostic before this journey. I had no evidence for or against God’s existence, and if God exists, God’s business is God’s business; I’m human, and I mind my own business. Then some God damned ungrateful motherfuckers decided to fuck with the first holiday I took for myself after I gave them full-site WiFi coverage for free. I still don’t know how much I spent at the campsite today. For the last 6 months, the people I once thought would lend a helping hand when needed wouldn’t even spare a coffee.I was extremely puzzled as to why the “rational” “thinkers” had such difficulty even remotely contemplating the possibility of God’s existence. For me, it was the single most comforting and reassuring piece of knowledge that I learned in life. And a reminder: four undergraduate degrees in mathematics, computer science, modern ballet, physics, and philosophy in the last decade. I could not comprehend why the existence of a righteous God was such bad news to them.Earlier this morning, I had the most terrifying hypothesis I had ever come up with, which sent me straight into denial. The hypothesis providing a plausible explanation for the puzzles above was not enough to cause me such distress after everything that happened in the last 15 months. The terror comes from Matthew 10:34-36 and 25:32. On top of that, the claim itself will make one claiming to be the messiah look like a child’s play in comparison.The magnitude of the potential implications warrants the bombardment of modest scholars in the field of psychology, and I will visit the scribes and Pharisees by entering through the front door this time. I have nothing left to prove to men. On the contrary, I must admit with guilt that I could not wait to watch the most majestic show unfold while enjoying a couple of Long Island Ice Tea and the symphony of weeping and gnashing of teeth.Not long ago, a “thinker” on LinkedIn compared theology to the study of fairy tales and unicorns when I tried to discuss rationally with them. As a 122-day believer, I had only an undergraduate education and had taken zero theology classes. Therefore, it would be most inappropriate to comment on the similarities between theology and fairy tales. I could only offer the observation that there are entire institutions in the city I visited last week dedicated to studying a collection of books written millennia ago. The only adjective I could come up with to describe humanity’s best-seller since getting my first one at the end of July last year is magic.I will remain silent on the hypothesis until I have sufficient weaponry to corner “rational” “thinkers”. Until that day, I will leave you with a cliffhanger/spoiler.In the unlikely event that the hypothesis is true, the evil of cosmic scale would be right in front of our very eyes, and people to whom salvation is possible would be running to Boss Man at full speed without much evangelical effort needed.Here is a final closing thought: Many of the decades-long devout Christ bros/sisses I met in the last 122 days were highly puzzled when I told them I didn’t know anyone in my life who talked about Jesus, except that time 11 years ago before I arrived in the United Kingdom. I thought dude was a religious nutjob back then. All I did was dramatically ask - could we bring God back in my heart after getting kicked out of the campsite? And placed an order for a humanity’s best seller on Amazon. What is He trying to say about you and your heart? Knowing that, unlike people, He truly sees is my ultimate source of comfort in the recent trials and persecutions.Enjoy, and God bless.Proverbs 26:27[27] Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, \tand a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling.

[18] Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. [19] And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. [20] For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.

I nearly threw myself off the balcony on the fifth-floor in front of my sister back in August.I declared bankruptcy three months ago and started writing down my story on my blog, HeSaid.Love (HeSaidLove.com), and I have written 245 posts on topics including but not limited to mathematics, physics, computer science, psychology, economics, philosophy, performing arts, and theology.

Despite the similar experiences in space but decades apart in time, I put together an email that would hopefully cause sufficient intellectual intrigue for a fellow Oxford graduate.I was 45 minutes late to the 1-hour discussion of God’s existence at King’s College London this evening. I thought about my motivation behind crying out loud to an esteemed community representative in parliament. I started writing about my journey at the end of October when I declared bankruptcy in the United Kingdom. Throughout this roller coaster ride, I constantly felt like I was drowning because no one had the time to hear me anymore, no matter how loud I screamed, shouted and kicked. If you graciously spent the time to read my 244 posts in this 120-day journey of faith, you should know I can really scream, shout and kick. The realisation that almost every friendship I treasured previously was worth not more than a cup of coffee also smashed my heart to pieces every other day. Less than a handful of people on my contact list still reply to my messages.I hoped to receive some free coffee through goodwill from strangers. But I realised this evening that all I could hope for at this point is for someone, anyone, to understand what happened and inform me what heinous crime against humanity I committed to deserve it all. Suppose you are reading this and have yet to venture into my insanity. In that case, you will have my wholehearted gratitude if you could refrain from judgment until you finish reading my testimony. After that, I will accept any criticism of how deprived a human being I am.In my usual fashion, I went 6,000 miles in a 90-second speech this evening at KCL to reiterate the ideas in my previous posts regarding faith, doubt, and morality. I hoped to metaphorically flip over the table again by expressing a personal belief concerning the issue of reason. I didn’t get the chance due to how passionate everyone was at reasoning about their opinions. Instead of waiting till next time, I will express my personal belief here as a plea to you.If you could graciously find the precious time from modern-day drug taking, please contemplate the difference between knowing and believing. You might discover René Descartes’ first two essays in Meditations on First Philosophy helpful in figuring out what you could reasonably know and how much you used to know are, in fact, beliefs without sound reason. In my humble opinion, you are not as reasonable and rational as you proclaim yourself to be if you believe you know way more than cogito, ergo sum.Genesis 3:13[13] Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” (ESV)" }, { "title": "On 2012", "url": "/posts/on-2012/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2025-01-15 09:17:00 +0000", "snippet": "The movie 2012 came out the year I started Chinese junior high school.

Kings shall shut their mouths because of him,for that which has not been told them they see, and that which they have not heard they understand.Isaiah 53:1-9[1] Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?[2] For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground;he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.[3] He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.[4] Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows;yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.[5] But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities;upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.[6] All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way;and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.[7] He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth;like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.[8] By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who consideredthat he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?[9] And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death,although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth." }, { "title": "On Isaiah 49", "url": "/posts/on-isaiah-49/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2025-01-12 08:12:00 +0000", "snippet": "I just sent an email to a dozen organisations including the Israeli embassy.If people didn’t backstab me to death in the last 15 months and the mofos in my life didn’t turn their backs on me, I wou...", "content": "I just sent an email to a dozen organisations including the Israeli embassy.If people didn’t backstab me to death in the last 15 months and the mofos in my life didn’t turn their backs on me, I would be the last person on earth to be interested.If it’s up to me, I will light it up without hesitation, but it’s already on fire so I wouldn’t bother.I sent the email to offer my assistance and feel free to ignore it like people do nowadays.I only want to get done with this shit and go home.It was my first proper distraction-free holiday ever at the campsite last year.Fucking cunts." }, { "title": "On Israel", "url": "/posts/on-israel/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation, israel", "date": "2025-01-12 06:09:21 +0000", "snippet": "Judging by the lyrics, I think Boss Man is quite pissed off about promiscuity. 🤔Isaiah 49:1-7The Servant of the LORD [1] Listen to me, O coastlands, and give attention, you peoples from a...", "content": "Judging by the lyrics, I think Boss Man is quite pissed off about promiscuity. 🤔Isaiah 49:1-7The Servant of the LORD [1] Listen to me, O coastlands, and give attention, you peoples from afar.

I watched a YouTube discussion between Dr. Jordan Peterson and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As mentioned in my previous psychology-related posts, I learned quite a lot about modern psychology from Dr. Jordan Peterson, and he’s quite good at presenting arguments from a biblical perspective in his lectures. Before this faith journey, my understanding of Israel and the conflicts in the region was limited to several crash course history videos I watched on YouTube when I stumbled across the Six-Day War. Other than that, I know their tech industry is quite well developed and Nvidia has quite a substantial research and development effort in Tel-Aviv.You may have noticed most of the scripture I quoted in my posts is from the New Testament. As a 110-day-old Christ bro, I find the teachings in the New Testament exceptionally helpful for day-to-day troubles and developed the project Bible Says Love (BibleSays.Love) to help me live a Bible-guided life since the scribes and Pharisees either stopped replying to my emails and messages or avoid eye contact with me in church. Before this week, I had only read the Book of Jonah and bits and pieces in the Old Testament when the sermons covered them. As mentioned in my posts this week, I had another scare when I read about the suffering servant in Isaiah 53. I went down the rabbit hole and read bits and pieces in books by other prophets in the Old Testament with a heavy focus on the Book of Daniel, the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Jeremiah.The Sunday morning 110 days ago, I read the Book of Romans (New Testament) chapters 1 to 4 for the first time before going to my first church service. I considered the Bible to be telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth because I felt the truth in my soul and like I was reading a personal letter addressed to me. Last night, when I was watching Netanyahu boasting about the Abraham Accords and the economic cooperation brought about by gaining favours with kings in the region and more importantly a certain global superpower, I felt that truth again from my sparse reading of the Old Testament. Some quick further research suggests Netanyahu, the region’s kings, the incoming golden calf and the golden calf’s son-in-law Jared Kushner are all in bed together worshipping a false idol called money. It appears rather ironic to an outsider like me that Israel considers its right to the land as God-given, and yet it’s also doing exactly what God told them not to do. What made matters even worse is God also told them they would be rebellious and do what He told them not to do.I spent around an hour of research into Judaism and Islam earlier this week and found out that the Old Testament is at least partially recognised by all three Abrahamic religions. I just found out that Jonah is the only one of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Hebrew Bible to be named in the Quran as I was doing real-time googling to confirm the accuracy of my statements. I have a weird feeling that the Old Testament alone contains enough prophecies and clues to demonstrate there is only one true God, the God of our fathers, the God of Abraham. Somehow, I think the most suitable emoji for that Day would be 🤡.Just two nights ago, I told Him I give up and please take my life away after realising a friendship was worth not more than a cup of coffee. If you read my posts, you should know how much I’m willing to give should a friend is ever in need. I couldn’t quite remember a time that I needed anyone’s serious help before the events of the last 15 months. I was doing pretty well myself making half a million as a digital nomad working remotely and taking on the role of a single parent for two younger siblings. For the last 6 months, I did nothing but ask and every mofo in my life turned their back on me. Only He came.Looking back, I wonder what did I get wrong to deserve all that. Looking forward, I wonder what did I get right to deserve someone like Him.I did consider studying for a theology degree including potentially going back to Oxford when I went bothering the chaplain of Regent’s Park College, Oxford. After the explicit and implicit rejections I received on this 4-month journey, I realised I shouldn’t waste time on that. I have more than one copy of the textbook and my teacher is the Author.Last but not least, I put on my crypto bro tin foil hat and generated a PGP key properly for the first time, in anticipation of the exciting journey ahead.

If you think I’m an exhibitionist in the sexual context, then all I can say is you won’t be able to find more than a handful of photos of me on the internet before this journey.As mentioned in my previous posts, I have a weird mental block that does not allow me to even consider sexual activity with people I know. I can only enjoy anonymous sex acts.Originally, I was planning to hide my face and it would have been an anonymous video on some popular NSFW video websites, and have a link displayed somewhere to direct one-way traffic. That would’ve been enough to reconnect my community with Jesus. However, He made me realise hiding my face is to hide my shame from men and it would mean I was still seeking the approval of men. Therefore, I decided not to hide my face from the world, despite the nakedness exposed is enough to make every human on earth turn their back on me. But at the end of the day, I know He will take care of me and I hope it also demonstrates the power of His love. Besides, what in the universe that He created can you hide from Him?Throughout this journey, I took a lot of seemingly insane leaps of faith and they were riddled with doubt and uncertainty at the beginning, but He always managed to remove them through scripture and demonstrating His love and care. The fear of making mistakes has been decreasing rapidly and it’s getting increasingly easier to discern His will from my will.I felt quite ill for the last two days partly due to physical exhaustion, but mostly from the leftover shame. Then I stumbled across Isaiah 53 concerning the suffering servant.Isaiah 53:1-3[1] Who has believed what he has heard from us?And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?[2]For he grew up before him like a young plant,and like a root out of dry ground;he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,and no beauty that we should desire him.[3]He was despised and rejected by men,a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;and as one from whom men hide their faceshe was despised, and we esteemed him not." }, { "title": "On Genesis 3 (Fall of Man)", "url": "/posts/on-genesis-3-fall-man/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2025-01-05 18:59:04 +0000", "snippet": "Had an interesting discussion with some interesting people today regarding the fall of man in Genesis 3.I still haven’t finished the Book of Genesis, it’s a long-ass book and I have been busy, but ...", "content": "Had an interesting discussion with some interesting people today regarding the fall of man in Genesis 3.I still haven’t finished the Book of Genesis, it’s a long-ass book and I have been busy, but I noticed something interesting when I read it a while back and shared it during the discussion. I read the chapter again after getting home and decided to write down my observations and understanding of what happened.The woman initially resisted the temptation by answering the serpent with what God commanded - not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The serpent tried again and successfully convinced the woman to take and eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.My understanding is the serpent gave the woman something she didn’t have before. The woman trusted and believed in God when she first answered the serpent. The serpent’s second attempt used reason to construct an argument and convinced the woman that she would be like God and know good and evil if she ate from the tree. After that conversation, the woman put reason before God and believed in the possibility of becoming like God.Is mankind trying to be like God? Do we know good and evil?How do we know eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will make us wise and know good and evil? Because the serpent said so.The entire Bible only mentions the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in Genesis 2 and 3 and the only thing God said will happen if we eat from it is we will die.It seems to me that most people don’t know how to spell good and evil let alone how to define them anymore. Everyone believes we are gonna die anyway, so whatever right?The serpent was crafty indeed.24 Jan 2025 edit: the thing the serpent gave the woman was doubt.31 Jan 2025 edit: At no point did I say to ditch reason. The woman would not have been able to rebuke the serpent without the ability to reason on the first attempt. The key is the order of precedence. The right order is God before reason rather than reason before God. Reason before God is impossible; if you prioritise reason, then you not only lose God, you also lose reason and end up with nothing, otherwise known as nihilism and death.Genesis 3:1-6The Fall[1] Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made.He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” [2] And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, [3] but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” [4] But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. [5] For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” [6] So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate." }, { "title": "On Sacrifice", "url": "/posts/on-sacrifice/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2025-01-05 11:45:28 +0000", "snippet": "I spent the last couple of days doing account verification on several websites that are in the top 50 websites by traffic/visitor.

This was made worse by the fact that I had been faithful to them in our relationships up to the point I asked for help. I simply could not comprehend why they could just turn their backs as though they did not know me.Hopeless in that faithlessness essentially led to the illness of nihilism. If you are unaware you are ill then you should read more books. Everyone simply blames the coldness of this world on that’s how things are and becomes indifferent to the suffering of others. Since everyone will die at the end, why not enjoy it as much as I can and fuck others right?As mentioned in my previous post titled “On the Equation of Love”, I came up with an equation to quantify love when I was 16. It’s the greatest amount of sacrifice one is willing to make. If you ask any father how much they are willing to sacrifice for their child, my guess is they would give up their own life at any time without hesitation.If you read my posts and believe I did do the things I did last year, then you should know how much I love you. If you still don’t believe it, then I prepared a New Year present for the world to accompany my Christmas presents.Tomorrow morning will mark my full 15 weeks as a Christian. The last 15 weeks were quite a roller coaster ride even for me. I wanted to either give up or burn the world down every other day, but He always managed to pick up me, fix me and cheer me up at the end of the day. I thought there might be a non-zero probability that I might have to burn the world down one day, but I realised I wouldn’t need to do that because it’s already on fire. It’s just most people are either sleepwalking or pretending to sleepwalk.I think the time is seriously near this time. And if you received my New Year present to the world and wonder why. It’s because of love, and to be honest I enjoyed preparing the present. I realised He made me who I am exactly for that reason, I just needed to realise I should seek to please Him rather than men. Although, I think this present might have managed to please all three relevant parties. 🤔Since the scribes and Pharisees either stopped replying to my emails or avoided eye contact with me, I figured they had enough light already and decided to put my light in places that needed it the most.

[2] And it was told to the king of Jericho, “Behold, men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.” [3] Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.” [4] But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. And she said, “True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. [5] And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.” [6] But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof. [7] So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords.

I don’t even need to read scripture proactively, Dude will shove scripture in my face to clear the doubts in my head whenever I need it. 🙄As mentioned previously, I don’t think any human being should have the authority to decide what scripture means. I think it’s okay to ask for help interpreting it, but everyone should read scripture themselves and context should not be neglected. Speaking from personal experience, it seems like as long as your faith is strong enough, He would also help with your inability to study His Word by shoving passages in your face.In an ideal scenario, I would prefer to memorize scripture, but I think 3 Bibles on my bed and 2 Bibles in my bag should be sufficient for a less than 15-week-old Christian intern.Colossians 3:12-17[12] Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, [13] bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.

The main thing I noticed in The “Gospel” of Thomas was the constant temptation offered to the reader hidden between the lines if they lean into their own understanding. And past a certain point, the “gospel” appears to suggest a direct relationship between God and the reader without Jesus. The “gospel” also seems to suggest the chosen elites should rejoice and be proud of the world’s rejection and prosecution, which caused quite a strong hangover given my recent personal experiences. However, my superficial conclusion on the “gospel” right now is it promotes pride in leaning into one’s own understanding of God rather than understanding through God, and that salvation is for the select few rather than mankind.One thing that caused quite a tsunami for me was the following, according to Thomas.Jesus said, “I am not your teacher. Because you have drunk, you have become intoxicated from the bubbling spring that I have tended.”Through my interactions with people from all walks of life in these past few months, I have noticed on multiple occasions, that a believer, regardless of denomination, will lose all interest in the conversation if you want to talk about life rather than scripture for a change. I once wanted to share my testimony with a group of ladies from Jahovah’s Witnesses when they were preaching on the streets because I thought my memes would brighten their day and make them laugh. I was met with instant rejection and they questioned why my testimony would make them laugh. They didn’t even want to take my beautifully designed business cards.I think we have got some drunkards even amongst believers.Also, I don’t think the book is a gospel.1 Corinthians 13:7-13[7] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.[8] Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. [11] When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. [12] For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.[13] So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love." }, { "title": "On Indignity", "url": "/posts/on-indignity/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2025-01-01 09:38:35 +0000", "snippet": "As alluded to previously, I don’t know how to spell oversharing and I was a regular in Berghain’s basement as a rampant homosexual.I struggled immensely with sexual desires.

My solution was to distract myself by writing salty posts and building the project Bible Says Love (BibleSays.Love). I managed to resolve the urges myself a handful of times in my 14 weeks as a believer.Unfortunately, I got too creative for my own good again and became even more rampant. Please hear me out. 🙏I do not consider myself to be a former homosexual, but I also recognise homosexuality is considered to be an abomination in scripture, whilst keeping in mind the sociological background when they were written. To put it simply, I won’t attempt to justify my homosexuality and I can imagine my Heavenly Father and the angels facepalming when I conduct abominations in the dark. I do feel guilty and apologise to Him after I regained mind clarity through performing certain mechanical and biochemical processes with my body.How then could I possibly feel justified and grow in holiness? I got exceptionally disappointed in myself last week, and I did not want Him to forgive me. Then I remembered hammer boi 🔨 from Wittenberg, Germany and the following passage from Mr Noisy Gong.2 Corinthians 12:9[9] But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.I agree with hammer boi 🔨 and believe that salvation is a gift of God’s grace through Jesus Christ received by faith and faith alone. I don’t think any good work can save you if you haven’t truly repented, and people who are truly saved will have the unstoppable urge to do good work. 🙈🫣🤡Therefore, I believe out of everything that He wants to say to us, His children, through that incredibly annoyingly thick bestseller, He wants us to know that love comes first and foremost. This, however, only reassures me of His forgiveness, but I was still unable to forgive myself for going against His wishes.Well… I came up with some whacky ideas to spread the gospel more effectively than STDs to my FWBs. As always, I went above and beyond and might sort out my finances by sharing deep knowledge in specific niches. 🙈How much dignity would I forego? Well, He saved my life. I do fear His wrath, but my love for my community is greater than my fear of burning in hell for eternity. And no, I won’t share my OnlyFans page here. Turns out I do have a bottom line, for now anyway. 🤔🫣🥹On a totally fictional note, how dramatic would it be if the Son of Man came back as a rampant homosexual? Might be humbling enough even for believers and shows God’s abundant mercy and relentless love. 🤔Hebrews 11:31[31] By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies." }, { "title": "On St Dunstan", "url": "/posts/on-st-dunstan/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2025-01-01 04:51:35 +0000", "snippet": "As mentioned previously, I studied A-Levels at St Dunstan’s College, Catford.

It’s a tradition for international students to visit St Dunstan-in-the-East in the city of London. The school has been associated with the parish since 1446.The church was originally built around year 1100. It was severely damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and it was patched up rather than being completely rebuilt. A steeple was added to the design of Sir Christopher Wren, who also designed St Paul’s Cathedral, London where the larger replica of the painting The Light of the World hangs. The smaller original painting hangs in the Side Chapel of Keble College, Oxford where I studied computer science between 2016 and 2019.The church was severely damaged again in the Blitz of 1941, and they decided not to rebuild the church and turned it into a public garden instead. It’s marked as good for kids on Google Maps and described as a city oasis surrounded by church ruins. The church is surrounded by three roads named St Dunstan’s Aly, St Dunstan’s Hill and Idol Ln.You can access the London City Voices Choir (City branch) on the west side of St Dunstan’s Aly. I guess on busy and chaotic days, it’s the aly (valley) where the kids collide into the morning.Going uphill to the north on St Dunstan’s Hill, you can reach The Minister Building across Great Tower St. On the foot of St Dunstan’s Hill and the building that’s also accessible via Idol Ln, you can find the museum Billingsgate Roman House &amp; Baths, 2000-year-old ruins of a Roman bath.If you travel east from the church, you will go through Cross Ln and Harp Ln, before reaching Water Ln or All Hallows by the Tower, a presidential wedding venue &amp; museum. Dunstan loved his Harp and didn’t stop playing it when the devil paid him a visit and tempted him.If you travel west from the church, you will go past St Mary at Hill before reaching the Monument to the Great Fire of London. I saw the monument on my way to the underground station. They gonna need a much bigger one once I’m done playing with fire.You tell me if I’m a chosen one.Luke 20:43[43] until I make your enemies your footstool.”’The Gospel of Thomas[21] Mary said to Jesus, “What are your disciples like?”He said, “They are like little children living in a field that is not theirs. When the owners of the field come, they will say, ‘Give us back our field.’ They take off their clothes in front of them in order to give it back to them, and they return their field to them.[32] Jesus said, “A city built on a high hill and fortified cannot fall, nor can it be hidden.”[39] Jesus said, “The Pharisees and the scholars have taken the keys of knowledge and have hidden them. They have not entered nor have they allowed those who want to enter to do so.[42] Jesus said, “Be passersby.”[75] Jesus said, “There are many standing at the door, but those who are alone will enter the bridal suite.”" }, { "title": "On the 144,000", "url": "/posts/on-144-000/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2024-12-31 20:15:13 +0000", "snippet": "Just a quick follow-up on my previous post.

It’s estimated that around 20% of the websites in the world use Cloudflare. The most insane part is the hosting cost to me personally is zero even if a couple of billion users decide to show up in the next 24hrs. The entire deployment of the project Bible Says Love is serverless and the only part that incurs costs is when a user submits a query to ask what the Bible says about a certain topic. The cost per million queries is less than a cup of coffee (£4/$5) for processing on OpenAI’s GPT-4o model and Cloudflare Workers to relay the requests and responses. That being said, still running out of coffee fast. 😉😉😉😉😉😉😉The email service I used wants to charge £0.54/$0.67 per thousand emails sent. Ain’t got that kinda money when I’m bankrupt and no one buys me coffee. 🫣😳☹️So I did some research into setting up a self-hosted email infrastructure. Once I have the IP addresses warmed up, I can deliver over a billion warning letters per month easy for less than 10 cups of coffee (£40/$50).

I’m writing to warn you of what’s to come and bring you two Christmas presents that I hope will help equip Christians globally to defend against the disaster that I believe will bring about the economic catastrophe described in Revelation 6:6 on a global scale.I wrote a rather emotionally charged open letter to churches earlier this week, but after the humbling events that took place in the last few days, I have learned my lesson and decided to tone down the language that I use in my writings. To put it simply, I have gone from dropping theological nuclear bombs to sprinkling extra-potent salt.I believe we are less than two years away from an economic disaster brought about by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will result in over 90% unemployment globally. You can read about my argument and reasoning in my posts titled “DEFCON 1”, “On Aerodynamics”, “On Unemployment Rates and Inflation”, “On the Middle East”, “On What I Think Will Happen” and “On Throwing Up”.Despite the grim outlook of what’s to come, I believe the following Christmas presents will help Christians globally to put on the full armour of God as well as preach the gospel to unbelievers, considering the suffering that is to come.Project Bible Says Love (BibleSays.Love) is a helper tool to help Christians live Bible-guided lives. It is meant to be a helper tool only and should always lead the user back to scripture and the importance of context should not be neglected.I also constructed a theological/philosophical/epistemological argument that I believe proves faith precedes reason. You can read about the argument in my post titled “On Faith Precedes Reason”.You can read about my journey in the rest of the posts. Apologies in advance for some of the language I used. I was rather emotional when I wrote them. I decided to prioritise truth and honesty over appearances and kept the good, the bad and the ugly.Here is my final message to you. He is coming back. There will be hard times ahead. Please hold onto your faith and best wishes.For Love and Devotion,From Your Fellow Servant,Jonah Troublemaker Yang" }, { "title": "On Throwing Up", "url": "/posts/on-throwing-up/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation, unemployment, employment, ai, openai, chatgpt, disaster, inflation", "date": "2024-12-21 09:59:49 +0000", "snippet": "I had a pretty big lunch yesterday and was travelling back home in the London underground when I had the confirmation for the economic scenario outlined in my previous posts titled “On What I Think...", "content": "I had a pretty big lunch yesterday and was travelling back home in the London underground when I had the confirmation for the economic scenario outlined in my previous posts titled “On What I Think Will Happen” and “On Aerodynamics”.I almost had a panic attack and felt absolutely sick to my stomach thinking what would happen if a 90% or 99% unemployment rate occurred.Once again, the Lord will take care of me and I’m not worried in the slightest for myself and my future.

Due to financial constraints, I had to do everything myself and I haven’t done HTML and CSS for over half a decade. The project is running on Cloudflare Workers &amp; Pages and it’s just a simple backend that relays the incoming request to OpenAI’s API for processing using the GPT-4o model. I had zero experience working with either Cloudflare or OpenAI’s API before this and I barely had to look at their API documentation.If you don’t have programming experience, I asked a fellow computer scientist from KCL last night to guess how long it took me to build it. His guess was one week.I spent most of the 2-3 hours fiddling with adjusting the user experience btw, the actual functionality was probably done in less than an hour.I’m paying for the processing of the model out of my pocket to OpenAI. The cost of serving 1 million requests on BibleSays.Love is less than a cup of coffee (£4/$5).How long will it take your employer to figure out they could do everything you are doing right now with nearly zero cost and in seconds?If your work is not more complicated than aerodynamics, then I believe you have less than 2 years.Good luck, best wishes and God bless. 🙏" }, { "title": "On the Middle East", "url": "/posts/on-middle-east/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-12-20 22:38:29 +0000", "snippet": "Reading my origin story on real-life-fantasy(dot)com and my early posts will provide the context for this post.If the events had not unfolded in the way that they did since April, I would be out of...", "content": "Reading my origin story on real-life-fantasy(dot)com and my early posts will provide the context for this post.If the events had not unfolded in the way that they did since April, I would be out of the United Kingdom by now according to my original plan. I travelled to Dubai earlier this year to set up my residence and I planned to party like there’s no tomorrow in Berlin for six months every year, detox in Dubai during the winter for three months whilst meeting the residence requirements for 0% income tax, and split the remaining three months between London and China. And I would be netting mid-six figures as a digital nomad.I originally planned a two-week trip to Dubai to set everything up, but I was in and out of the country within 96 hours. In those 96 hours, I had a health check completed in under 10 minutes which involved a blood test and a chest X-ray, had the phone contract setup and bank account opened, had my biometric appointment and the visa was approved as well as received the residence permit within 48 hours.I mainly ordered takeaways to be delivered to my Airbnb and I noticed a couple of strange incidents where the delivery drivers kept apologising to me for being a couple of minutes late. I had no idea they were late if they didn’t apologise to me in the first place. Their exceptionally apologetic attitude made me quite uncomfortable since I do not see the need for that over a minor delay that could very well be due to factors outside their control. I later found out that one bad customer review pretty much means their future in the country is done and they will be sent packing. They have a near-unlimited supply of low-cost labour from nearby countries that are at the bottom range for GDP per capita.If you have enough zeros in your bank account and want to be served like a God, then the Middle East is your heaven.Feel free to read my post titled “On Possible Antichrists” for my list of potential candidates." }, { "title": "On My Plan", "url": "/posts/on-my-plan/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-12-20 20:44:04 +0000", "snippet": " Warn as many people as possible.

These are also the commodities of the common person: basic staples for living. The implication seems to be that most people in this part of the tribulation are struggling just to meet their basic survival needs. This is the kind of poverty which threatens a person’s life, not merely their lifestyle.However, the voice from the midst of the four living creatures also commanded, “Do not harm the oil and wine!” Oil and wine, in this context, are less crucial supplies, making them a form of minor luxury. The implication that these are not harmed might suggest that wealthy people would not be hurt by the economic or inflationary catastrophe. According to Revelation 13:16–17, the false prophet in Jerusalem will control commerce during the tribulation, making it extremely difficult for tribulation believers to purchase even basic commodities.Edit: add Revelation 6:6 and the interpretation from BibleRef." }, { "title": "DEFCON 1", "url": "/posts/defcon-1/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-12-20 16:26:03 +0000", "snippet": "Edit: you can read my letter to the world here.If you are an unbeliever, then no need to continue reading.If you are a believer and believe that the Holy Spirit is working in me after reading my po...", "content": "Edit: you can read my letter to the world here.If you are an unbeliever, then no need to continue reading.If you are a believer and believe that the Holy Spirit is working in me after reading my posts, then I think I just had confirmation for the economic scenario described in my previous post titled “On Aerodynamics”.I don’t think we even have two years.I’m going to warn as many people as possible.Let me know if you wanna help.Otherwise, good luck. 🙏Revelation 6:6" }, { "title": "On Aerodynamics", "url": "/posts/on-aerodynamics/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation, job, offer, ai, openai, chatgpt", "date": "2024-12-20 13:03:20 +0000", "snippet": "Suppose I want to save some drug addicts with keywords like portfolio, manager and analyst in their job titles from overdosing this bonus season by sprinkling some extra-potent salt to bring them b...", "content": "Suppose I want to save some drug addicts with keywords like portfolio, manager and analyst in their job titles from overdosing this bonus season by sprinkling some extra-potent salt to bring them back to life.

On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. [11] For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy." }, { "title": "On Advice", "url": "/posts/on-advice/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation, advice, judgement", "date": "2024-12-16 09:16:35 +0000", "snippet": "Almost every single time I ask people for help they just start giving me unsolicited advice lately.

As a bilingual speaker, I know that lost in translation is a real thing, and I did consider learning Hebrew at one point, but it’s not currently on my to-do list due to my laziness.I have also purchased and seen/read more than half a dozen different versions of the Holy Bible now in English and Simplified/Traditional Chinese. One common phrase left a strong impression in my mind whilst reading the foreword/introduction of all these different Bible versions.This Holy Bible has been faithfully translated.I realised if I were to have faith and believe in an almighty God.

[4] In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. [5] And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?“My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,nor be weary when reproved by him.[6] For the Lord disciplines the one he loves,and chastises every son whom he receives.”[7] It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? [8] If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.Proverbs 3:11-12[11] My son, do not despise the LORD’s disciplineor be weary of his reproof,[12] for the LORD reproves him whom he loves,as a father the son in whom he delights.Proverbs 12:1[1] Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,but he who hates reproof is stupid.Proverbs 27:5-6[5]Better is open rebukethan hidden love.[6]Faithful are the wounds of a friend;profuse are the kisses of an enemy.2 Samuel 7:14[14] I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men,P.S. I hope the pun is unintended in the last one.

[7] By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household.

The disciples rebuked the people, [14] but Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”Matthew 18:1-6Who Is the Greatest?[1] At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” [2] And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them [3] and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. [4] Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.[5] “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, [6] but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.1 John 3:1-3[1] See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. [2] Beloved, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. [3] And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.Romans 8:12-17Heirs with Christ[12] So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. [13] For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. [14] For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. [15] For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” [16] The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, [17] and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.Matthew 5:8[8] “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.Disclaimer: check local ballooning regulations." }, { "title": "On Anger", "url": "/posts/on-anger/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation, anger, angermanagement", "date": "2024-12-04 08:04:14 +0000", "snippet": "If you don’t know me personally and you have read my recent posts where I dropped a ton of f-bombs, you are not going to believe it when I tell you that I rarely remember a time I was angry and abs...", "content": "If you don’t know me personally and you have read my recent posts where I dropped a ton of f-bombs, you are not going to believe it when I tell you that I rarely remember a time I was angry and absolutely pissed off since puberty, until this journey.Dude definitely gave me a bad temper. 🙄🤔🤷Ephesians 4:26-27[26] Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, [27] and give no opportunity to the devil.Matthew 21:12-13Jesus Cleanses the Temple[12] And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.

They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel.

[14] I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.Acts 17:26-27[26] And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, [27] that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,Romans 10:9-10[9] because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

My mind was full of doubt thinking how could that even be remotely possible considering the securities that would no doubt be around the gigantic fig tree in Rome.

Wouldn’t it be funny if somehow the main character just waltzes into the main government building with zero preparation and somehow succeeds?I believe the King of Drama could certainly write a script like that. 🤔On an unrelated note, I had a call with my missionary guide based in mainland China after I arrived in NYC and consulted his opinion on Catholicism. He informed me that the reformed churches were born out of the roman catholic church during the Reformation.I was also looking for a church to attend the upcoming Sunday service when I was in NYC. I stayed with a Chinese high school friend who works in NYC and He managed to lead me to a reformed church nearby when the area was full of fig trees, being northeast US and all.And the sermon that Sunday?Mark 11:12-14Jesus Curses the Fig Tree[12] On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. [13] And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. [14] And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it.The moment I read “for it was not the season for figs”, I was hit by a lightning bolt.Why on earth would I understand some random line on mankind’s best seller the first time I read about it and it somehow removed all the doubt in my mind??? 🤷I sent Binding of Issac (Genesis 22) to my friends who were understandably concerned. I wanted them to know that I have faith in God’s righteousness and He won’t let me do anything stupid or unrighteous, but at the end of the day, my obedience precedes all else, including my own needs and advice from people I trust in life.Hence, I seek advice from people, but I only seek guidance from Him.

[8] Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. [9] In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. [10] In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. [11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

I hope that day never comes, but I realised I would always choose God because He represents truth and righteousness, and if mankind turned its back on those two things then I would never side with mankind. The terror comes from the fact that there was more than one occasion in my life where my entire world was telling me I was wrong, but I still chose what I believed to be right and ended up proving I made the right choice.Chaplain Beth at Regent’s Park College, Oxford provided further insights from a theological perspective and I realised God can always save mankind by miraculously turning someone as blind as me back to Him, and therefore hopefully mankind would never completely turn its back to God.However, just because He loves us, doesn’t mean we have a license to abuse His love.

I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. [22] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, [23] gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.

For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. [2] Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. [3] For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, [4] for he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer. [5] Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. [6] For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. [7] Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.Disclaimer: the photo below is just a random picture from my camera roll.Edit: I have a significantly lower cost solution figured out. 🎈 Although could still use a drone expert for a different scenario. 😉" }, { "title": "On Bravery and Courage", "url": "/posts/on-bravery-courage/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2024-11-22 14:17:48 +0000", "snippet": "Proverbs 3:5-6[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,and do not lean on your own understanding.[6] In all your ways acknowledge him,and he will make straight your paths.Proverbs 28:1[1] The wick...", "content": "Proverbs 3:5-6[5] Trust in the LORD with all your heart,and do not lean on your own understanding.[6] In all your ways acknowledge him,and he will make straight your paths.Proverbs 28:1[1] The wicked flee when no one pursues,but the righteous are bold as a lion.Proverbs 24:15-18[15]Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous;do no violence to his home;[16]for the righteous falls seven times and rises again,but the wicked stumble in times of calamity.[17]Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles,[18]lest the LORD see it and be displeased,and turn away his anger from him.Proverbs 2:7-8[7] he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,[8] guarding the paths of justiceand watching over the way of his saints.Proverbs 14:16-18[16]One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil,but a fool is reckless and careless.[17]A man of quick temper acts foolishly,and a man of evil devices is hated.[18]The simple inherit folly,but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.Proverbs 31:8-9[8] Open your mouth for the mute,for the rights of all who are destitute.[9] Open your mouth, judge righteously,defend the rights of the poor and needy.Proverbs 29:25[25]The fear of man lays a snare,but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe.I have the following quote from Billy Graham on my first Christian journal." }, { "title": "On Control and Freedom", "url": "/posts/on-control-freedom/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, salvation", "date": "2024-11-22 13:54:53 +0000", "snippet": "I have never felt more free and happy despite the lack of material provisions in my life.", "content": "I have never felt more free and happy despite the lack of material provisions in my life." }, { "title": "On Sexual Needs", "url": "/posts/on-sexual-needs/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, salvation, abstinence", "date": "2024-11-22 13:50:19 +0000", "snippet": "I think I’m gonna try abstinence until my Boss comes back and ask Him daily for strength and courage to overcome.

Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”[6] Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, [7] casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.

[19] For it is written,“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”[20] Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? [21] For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. [22] For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, [23] but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, [24] but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.

[3] By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.[4] By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks. [5] By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. [6] And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

And since they had no root, they withered away. [7] Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. [8] Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. [9] He who has ears, let him hear.”1 Corinthians 3:5-9[5] What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. [6] I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.

He saw my memes on LinkedIn and reached out. Turns out his grandma is also a believer and he’s on a quest to prove God’s existence by identifying statistical anomalies. He asked me specifically about my experience during the first visit back in late August concerning the auditory aspects through music I collected over the last 9 years or so on Spotify. I won’t repeat them here and you can read more on my previous post titled “On the Holy Spirit and Miracles”.I had a similar discussion with one of my guides, the Christian missionary in mainland China. We both like going for walks whilst listening to music. The revelations are less strong nowadays compared to late August and I can hear less of His Word coming through. One thing I have noticed is the revelations are super context dependent, and the same lyrics/songs can provide different revelations/solutions/directions/instructions depending on what’s on my mind when I heard them. I have the same experience when it comes to reading scripture. For instance, every time I read the Book of Revelation, I was able to identify different meaning that I either previously did not realise could be interpreted that way, or another possiblity that would provide a completely new perspective on the overall interpretation.Similar experiences were also observed in the early days when I was exploring my faith. Even before I went all-in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour, there were a handful of times I was led to scripture via some random research that I was doing online on some random problems that I had at the time. I would open up my bible, find the corresponding verse, read the context around that particular verse, and nearly poop myself every single time, because the context almost 1,000% corresponds to the situation that I was dealing with at the time. It was feeling the truth in my bones kind of deep. I have never read any book or any article that could cut that deep and I could literally feel the truth in my soul. I simply do not see how something like that could be from humans, and the only plausible explanation I could come up with is divinity.2 Timothy 3:12-17[12] Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, [13] while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. [14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it [15] and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

I believe this kind of love unites rather than divides, and is way more effective.The scripture also teaches us to love the Lord and our neighbours, and warns us against being lovers of ourselves.Matthew 22:34-40The Great Commandment[34] But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.

That venue is called Club Church and please send my regards to the bouncer next time you’re there.I call myself a rampant homosexual because I’m what’s known as a bad gay even amongst my community. Most of my travel destinations over the last 12 months or so are major European LGBT destinations and I spent a substantial amount of time in sex venues. These venues can be rather dark for acts of abomination. Over the six months period that I travelled, I estimate there were over a handful of times where I had to call the staff because someone was passing out and no one, absolutely freaking none, cared about that person’s wellbeing.And therefore, that Sunday morning when I read Romans 1-4, I felt the truth in my bones when reading the following passage.Romans 1:22-32[22] Claiming to be wise, they became fools, [23] and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.[24] Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, [25] because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.[26] For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; [27] and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.[28] And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. [29] They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, [30] slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, [31] foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. [32] Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.That being said, I still believe I’m a homosexual and just because I’m a Christian doesn’t mean I’m straight now. We all fall short of the glory of God, and yet He still loves us no matter what.

Were those three months at the campsite divine intervention, because an ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID essentially came true? And could we bring God back?I was being rather dramatic when it comes to the second question. I asked that because some German dude named Friedrich Nietzsche once said God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed Him. What I meant by the second question was could we restore faith in each other’s hearts and don’t by default assume we want something from each other for malicious or ill intent.Matthew 6:24[24] “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.

[12] For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [13] This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. [14] Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: “‘“You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive.” [15] For this people’s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.’ (ESV)" }, { "title": "On Divisions in the Church", "url": "/posts/on-divisions-church/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, bible, salvation", "date": "2024-11-13 09:23:30 +0000", "snippet": "I believe He would like me study the various denominations based on my encounters with Christians throughout my recent travel.

[2] I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, [3] for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way? [4] For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not being merely human?[5] What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. [6] I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. [7] So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. [8] He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. [9] For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s field, God’s building.[10] According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it. [11] For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. [12] Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw—[13] each one’s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. [14] If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. [15] If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.[16] Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? [17] If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.[18] Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. [19] For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness,” [20] and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.” [21] So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, [22] whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, [23] and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.

Most of the things discussed below are based on my superficial preliminary research and as always any feedback/input are much appreciated and welcome. 🙏On IslamAs alluded to in my previous post titled “On the Holy Spirit and Miracles”, the existence of the Holy Spirit is an a posteriori knowledge to me personally and I have yet to find a way to prove the existence of the Holy Spirit using a priori reasoning. I believe based on my initial superficial research that the Prophet Muhammad is considered to be the last and final prophet to receive the Holy Spirit. This view contradicts my personal subjective experience and therefore I personally consider Islam to be a false religion.On BuddhismThe biggest problem I personally have regarding Buddhism is that they teach people to harvest God like spiritual power. Furthermore, some of the practices involve relics that are formed using human body parts including skulls and skins. Coming from the perspective of a Christian intern, this is practicing witchcraft. Further details can be found in the Wikipedia article on Śarīra.As far as I’m aware, nowhere in the bible are Christians taught to practice such things. We are in fact actively warned against such practices and Jesus performed exorcism to cast out demons.I would also like to ask the following questions to Buddhists. How many times throughout human history, has the dragon slayer became the dragon, and the revolutionary became the dictator? Could we really trust human nature to have God like power? My personal opinion is that the desire of such spiritual power also stems from pride.As always, not seeking to convince or persuade, but open to respectful discussions. 🙏🫶😘Edit: it has been pointed out to me by a friend that witchcraft practices also occurred in Christianity throughout history, which is factually correct, but I want to stress that those practices deviated from scripture. We all make mistakes, but that doesn’t mean we can’t do better or go back onto the right path. It’s also been pointed out to me that the scenario of dragon slayer becoming the dragon doesn’t really exist in Buddhism. I’m mistaken there and will do further research before following up with the topic.

[27] But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; [28] God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, [29] so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.

As mentioned in a previous post titled “Reasoning Behind Preaching in Mainland China Jonah Style”, I believed in God for about a week after and concluded that I must have been hallucinating.On the second day when He came to the rescue back in late August, I grabbed my backpack and all of my travel documents, and was ready to jump in an Uber straight to Heathrow and fly back to mainland China, but I ended up turning Him down and He told me to think about why.I took a somewhat scientific approach when it comes to accepting God’s existence and Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour. The three day experience with Him was mostly auditory. I had just over 300 songs in my Spotify playlist at the time that I collected over the last 9 years or so (Spotify Desktop shows you the date the song was added to the playlist). My music taste is extremely random and I have the likes of Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Sam Smith, all the way to Tchaikovsky and soundtracks from The Greatest Showman. Somehow over that three day period, He started to speak to me through the lyrics of the songs, song after song, line after line without fail. Spotify also occasionally adds recommendations via Smart Shuffle mode and His Word also managed to come through. I remember staring at my Nest Audio speakers and thinking whether Spotify has improved their AI so much that they have managed to make me hallucinate and believe in a deity now. I also considered the fact that, if a deity does indeed exist, then how would I know if it’s God or the devil. As a result, I told Him I could really only believe for 95% that there is a God, and the only things that I could commit to 100% are truth and reason. Weirdly, He seemed to be fine with that.During day 2 of the first visit back in August, and before I grabbed my backpack, something else also happened and the experience was not auditory, but sensorial. I told my therapist about that experience a week later, he nearly fell out of his chair, and directed me towards something in the Bible and I found an entire Wikipedia page on the topic, which concerns the Holy Spirit. The interesting thing about my therapist is that he happens to consider himself a Christian first and a psychologist second. I also did not start seeing my therapist due to mental illness. My therapist’s office was unfortunately situated next to the office I moved into when I did a crypto mining project during COVID. I found myself working alone in the office at 2 AM on Sundays and thought life was a bit stressful and it might be a good idea to speak to someone regularly as a reality check. The topics of religion and God came up probably less than a handful of times for the last couple of years and I had weekly sessions so that someone could slap me awake in case I get detached from reality.On the Friday that my scientific materialistic worldview collapsed, I was sitting in an Uber and contemplating what sort of miracles would I want to see before believing that God exists. The moment came when the following question showed up in my head. How big of a fucking miracle and how much more do you fucking want Him to show you other than all that is in front of your very eyes, that you wake up to everyday and breath in and out of your body every second? I became a 100% believer in God that exact moment, but I was only still 95% when it comes to Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour.During this period of exploring my faith, I also reconnected with someone I have not spoken to for 11 years and have only met him once in my life. He helped with my secondary school application in the United Kingdom back in 2012/2013 and we met once after my arrival in London. I reestablished contact with him because I remember him talking about Jesus and his faith for some random reason that I could not remember. I thought he was a religious nut job back then. The first call we had after not speaking for 11 years lasted 6.5hrs and we were arguing about semantic differences in the Bible. And on our second or third phone call, I confessed to him about my sexuality, and he spoke in tongues. When he spoke in tongues, I felt an overwhelming presence of the Holy Spirit which confirmed His existence for me and basically led me to believe that the day of Pentecost described in Acts 2 did in fact happen.Coming back down to earthly affairs and for those of you who know me personally, please contemplate the following question, perhaps with your heart rather than your brain this time. I had zero interest in religion previously, and three months ago I couldn’t tell you the difference between Christianity and Catholicism, but I walked into the Vatican city with two lighters in my pocket couple weeks ago and I’m in Moscow, Russia right now looking into Russian Orthodox Churches. Wouldn’t you call that a miracle?Also, it’s not a religion that I’m subscribing to. I found my faith." }, { "title": "On Expected Value/Return", "url": "/posts/on-expected-value-return/", "categories": "", "tags": "christbro, salvation, probability, bible, secondcoming, mathematics", "date": "2024-11-08 10:29:31 +0000", "snippet": "If you’re not a crypto/finance/tech/maths bro, or it’s been a while since your last lecture on probability 101, here’s some prerequisite reading on expected value/return.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/...", "content": "If you’re not a crypto/finance/tech/maths bro, or it’s been a while since your last lecture on probability 101, here’s some prerequisite reading on expected value/return.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_valueLet’s assume your mind is not yet so blinded by the god of this world (money or whatever), and the probability of what I’m saying turns out to be true is some astronomically small number, say 1 over 1^36 for the sake of argument and let’s denote this number as P.

The universe is indifferent to our suffering and there is no objective morality. I got to a point where choosing to kill myself and not kill myself on any single day are effectively the same choice due to the lack of objective meaning. The schools of existentialism and nihilism are enticing, because once you get through the initial phase, you realise you can do anything you want and any evil becomes justifiable on a sliding scale, it’s just a matter of whether you can get away with it.

I thought at the time that the greatest amount of sacrifice one could make is to die for the person they love, and second to that would be choosing to leave regardless of how much it hurts knowing that it’s the best they could do for the person they love.Then I learned that God sent His only begotten son Jesus Christ to die for our sins.

I remained rebellious and did not obey His wishes.After returning to Hong Kong from my half-assed three day preaching in mainland China Jonah style, I went over to Macau and took a break to observe Sabbath. I played some poker at the venetian casino and tripled my stack within half an hour, but the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. I decided to leave after about an hour since I mistakenly thought the casino climate control department would have mercy on ignorant tourists who made the strategic mistake of walking in with a T-shirt - I caught a cold basically. I thanked the Lord for the small winnings that covered the cost of travel, hotel and food, and called it a night.I went for a breakfast the next morning, bought a new pack of cigarettes at a nearby shop, and noticed the cost was nearly 1/3 compared to Hong Kong. I bought two cartons at the duty free store after exiting the border in Macau, since that’s the amount we would always bring for my heavy-smoking biological father every time we travel home from Hong Kong.The officers at the Hong Kong border warmly welcomed my arrival and directed me towards the scanner shortly before realising they have catch of the day. Evidently the limit of cigarette imports on the other direction is 19 cigarettes and I was over the limit by 404 cigarettes. Two officers escorted me over to the search area and one of them started chatting to me whilst the other officer went through my luggage. I alerted them in advance that I may have approximately 7 or 8 bibles in my luggage, which evidently was a rather intriguing area of discussion the officers would like to explore. I gave my detailed account of recent events including my mission in mainland China in native cantonese as the officers ran a thorough background check on my Caribbean passport. The officer who kept me entertained for nearly two hours informed me that he went to a catholic school and I explained to him why I consider catholicism to be misguided. My choice of adjective did not upgrade to “wrong” until later on in the trip.There was also a strip search and I hesitated for approximately 3 seconds before taking off my underwear, mainly for the benefit of the officers since I sensed discomfort from their body language, unlike me who spent three months running ethernet cables on a gay/bi naturist campsite.Their colleagues stood up from their cubicles to look at me once I made a generous donation to the Hong Kong customs department for violating the cigarette import limits.

They practically mentally tortured me for six months, and it was the main driver behind taking a break at the campsite back in April. Even after everything they had put me through over the last 12 months, I still wanted to share the gospel with them and hoped that they would see the light, until they threw scripture in my face, accused me of not knowing God’s love, and claimed that it is prideful to want to save others. I realised there’s nothing more I could do at that point, because if Jesus returns tomorrow and offers them salvation, then they would also accuse Jesus of being prideful and not knowing love. I was only saved six weeks ago, what could I possibly do if even Jesus can’t offer them help?If I had to take a guess as to why He decided to save me, I would say it’s probably because I’m loyal and faithful even to the point of death.I pledged to be His loyal servant forever and ever back in September.

After all, I have only gone all-in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour less than six weeks ago, and I’m super-duper ignorant on all matters Christian. 🙏Thou shalt not worship false idols.IMHO, the pope is a false idol and should not have equal standing as scripture. I believe everyone should read the Word of God themselves and it’s okay to ask for help with understanding it, but no human being should have the authority to decide how to interpret scripture.Furthermore, I believe one should ask God the Father directly in their prayers for things that they want, rather than through saints and apostles. This is worshiping false idols all over again, and commercialising God through the selling of prayer/holy cards.Joel 3:3[3] and have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it. (ESV)I believe the boy referred to here is Jesus Christ and feel free to infer the rest based on certain contexts.Lastly, I’m aware that sexual abuse is a global issue, but if I were to pick a top offender that systematically covered up abuses and pushed people away from God, you can probably take an educated guess.I believe I’m a Baptist since the first church He led me to was a Baptist church, before I even knew what the various Christian denominations meant. I was so ignorant that I thought the various denominations were at war with each other in the early phase of discovering my faith. Upon further research on the principles each denomination represents, I realised if I were to pick one myself, the Baptists’ philosophy is the closest to my personal philosophy. He knew. 🙄I also discovered that Modern Baptist churches trace their roots back to the Protestant Reformation, which separated from the Roman Catholic Church.

When the action is on Him, He casually looks at His hand, doesn’t even bother to cover it, casually picks up some chips, and bets as though He doesn’t have the slightest worry in the world. He then goes back to reading the bible, and doesn’t bat an eye on you the whole time.

The only option I have, is to have faith in Him and ask Him for strength and courage daily in my prayers to overcome the temptation. I realised I’m no longer walking on this earth alone even when I’m alone. I have Him walking with me now and I can lean on Him rather than going at it all by myself.

However, if murderers and criminals can find salvation through Christ, then why couldn’t my community find salvation through Christ? After all, the Father is annoyingly loving and forgiving, I would encourage everyone to keep an open heart when it’s late and peaceful at night, and give Him a chance to show you His love.

I have never felt more loved/loving, trusted/trusting, and brave/fearless my entire life.

I laughed out loud the first time I read the story of Jonah, partly because it’s quite a funny story, but mainly because it’s the story of my life metaphorically speaking and no I didn’t get swallowed by a great fish in real life. Jonah tried to run away from God after his first calling. I had my first calling during COVID whilst in Scotland and believed in God for about a week afterwards, but concluded that I must have been hallucinating. Additionally, whatever Jonah tried to do with full effort failed and whatever he did half-assed succeeded without much effort. I tried to find the meaning of life without God and ended up with existentialism, nihilism, and anti-natalism. I put little effort into my education and ended up in the university whose alumni are the culprits behind the mess in British politics today. I sought after truth and knowledge my entire life and turns out they are written on the best seller in mankind’s history, and took a 540 degree turn in life. 🥲I went south and moved back to London after completing my degree at RCS. Fell asleep on the ship of capitalism and got burnt out. I voluntarily got swallowed by a gay/bi naturist campsite and was vomited out three months later. Had my second calling in late August 2024 and finally decided to comply.By some magical and wishful thinking, I wanted to stop the Book of Revelation and considered the book to be the disaster that God had said he would do to mankind. And in this specific context, the great city of Nineveh represents both China and mankind for me. I managed to develop a massive saviour complex and thought it would be worth a try, just in case I’m the sign of Jonah as described in Matthew 12:39. I had this fantastical idea that if somehow the entire China repents and becomes Christian, mankind would follow suit and repent. Hence stopping the book of revelation. But I guess it’s a moonshot and I probably failed. Well, it was worth a shot anyway. 🙁However, not all hope is lost yet. Following the insane logic of mankind as the great city of Nineveh, Plan B would be to evangelise the world, but perhaps I should finish reading the bible first. I have only read revelation (more than half a dozen times now), Jonah, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, and bits and pieces from the other books. 😰In case anyone is wondering for some weird reason, the message I preached in mainland China is the same as the one in the Book of Jonah, except with Nineveh replaced with the People’s Republic of China.

In the book of revelation, it says the mark will be on people’s foreheads and right hands. The idea of having 666 tattooed on people’s foreheads nowadays in the physical world seem rather insane even for someone as far gone as me, and I don’t see how it could actually happen given we also have the warning in scripture. I believe the right hand symbolises righteousness in scripture. How many people in this world still consider God to be righteous rather than consider money to be righteous, and have God in their mind rather than money? It says people cannot buy or sell without it, perhaps that’s just money. When push comes to shove and even amongst Christians, how many would actually choose to stand firmly with God rather than money? So I think 666 is a spiritual mark and it represents money or the love of it in the real world.

Lived the digital nomad lifestyle for six months Oct 2023 - Apr 2024. Regularly attended very interesting parties in Berlin and a frequent visitor to the basement of Berghain as a rampant homosexual. Walked around to admire the architecture of Berghain during Easter Snax and got bored. Booked a trip in a rented caravan at a naturist campsite called Rosebay in Peterborough. Walked up with a Gen 2 Starlink dish, bought a new Swift caravan and moved in two weeks later. Gave them full site Wi-Fi coverage for free with UniFi and UISP equipments using Starlink as uplink because the community was really nice to me at the beginning. Three months later I got kicked out for breaking the No. 1 rule of caravanning - staying within my pitch. I unintentionally broke the rule trying to maintain consistent network uptime and have a direct line of sight between antennas to bridge the network at reception. Got my first bible a week after getting kicked out since an ethical thought experiment I designed during COVID essentially came true at the campsite and I thought it was divine intervention. Almost killed myself to prove my innocence and He visited me for three days in late August and saved me.Regularly throws tantrums at Him and go on rage walks every other day, but He and I both know I will be going home once I’m done letting the steam out. He makes me laugh, cry and annoyed (roughly 25% of the time), but at the end of the day He always fills my heart with joy. I’m regularly annoyed because He digs holes, lets me walk over and fall, picks me up, wipes my tears, dusts me off and tells me to go play. The thought of I would not learn unless I fall still pisses me off regularly.I designed a thought experiment when it comes to sinning. Suppose I make a hotel booking and plan to sin hard with a FWB. The annoyingly gracious Father insists on driving me there and takes away all other means of transport just because He can. I don’t have a driving license so I kinda have no other choice but to let Him. He parks the car when we get there and tells me to go do whatever it is that I need to do in there, and He will be waiting in the carpark to drive me home when I’m done. Dude makes it really difficult to even get out of the car and kills the mood in an instant.I made almost the exact arrangements on the day I was supposed to return to London from Rome after failing to burn down a gigantic fig tree. I took a nap before my flight and He made me wet without dreaming and missed my flight. I had to wait six additional hours at the airport to reflect on my thoughts and actions. Turns out rebellion only brings momentary satisfaction and true happiness comes from obedience as God’s children." } ]
